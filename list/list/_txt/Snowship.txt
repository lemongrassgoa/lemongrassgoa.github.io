I was only looking for the treasure in the dark
Not the trees and people in the middle of the park
But the treasure's buried beneath years and years of time [A]

He put his hand in my hand and he told me, "Son,
When they all come looking for you, where you gonna run?
Your heart's wired up to the eyes in your head
and they're flashing bright."

I signed a deal with the devil and he took my soul
To a room with a table in the dark and cold
I signed my name just the same as I'd done on the line before [A]

I was in the middle of the cliff and the sea
With a ditch right behind me that the bitch couldn't see
She came right at me with her teeth and her dress 
and they both fell off.
