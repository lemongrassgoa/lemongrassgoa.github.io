Fleetwood Mac
Landslide (orig. Eb)

INTRO: | F      C/E       Dm      C/E

I took my love, I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
'Till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?  ..... G

    |     C         Em        Am
    Well, I've been afraid of changing
    |           F        C           Dm     G 
    'Cause I've built my life around you
    |   C              Em            Am
    But time makes you bolder / Even children get older
    |   F           C     Em      C
    And I'm getting older too


(SOLO) F      C/E       Dm      C/E   .....   G


    Well, I've been afraid of changing
    'Cause I've built my life around you
    But time makes you bolder / Even children get older
    And I'm getting older too / Oh, I'm getting older too

Oh, take my love, take it down
Oh, climb a mountain and turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide will bring it down

And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills ...

Well the landslide will bring it down, oh oh
The landslide will bring it down
