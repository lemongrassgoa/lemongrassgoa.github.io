Savage Garden
The Animal Song (orig F#) [rhythm: 909 Clap, bpm: 117]

| E    Es4    F#m7   B7s4
When superstars and cannonballs are running through your head 
A television freak show, cops and robbers everywhere 
Subway makes me nervous, people pushing me too far 
I've got to break away / So take my hand now

    | E     A/E     F#m7   B7s4
    'Cause I want to live (like animals) 
    Careless and free (like animals)
    I want to live / I want to run through the jungle 
    |   C#m        A            F#m7       B7s4     (intro theme)
    The wind in my hair and the sand at my feet 

| E    Es4    F#m7   B7s4
I've been having difficulties keeping to myself 
Feelings and emotions better left up on the shelf 
Animals and children tell the truth, they never lie 
Which one is more human / There's a thought, now you decide 

| E    Es4    F#m7   B7s4
Compassion in the jungle / Compassion in your hands, yeah 
Would you like to make a run for it
Would you like to take my hand, yeah 

    | E     A/E     F#m7   B7s4
    'Cause I want to live (like animals) 
    Careless and free (like animals)
    I want to live / I want to run through the jungle 
    |   C#m        A            F#m7       B7s4     C#m .....
    The wind in my hair and the sand at my feet 

        [E] Sometimes this life can get you down / [C#m] It's so confusing 
        There's so many [E] rules to follow / And I [C#m] feel it 
        'Cause I just run away in my [E] mind
