Under The Sea

C     C     G      C
The seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there, but that is a big mistake
F     C     G      C
Just look at the world around you, right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you - what more is you lookin' for?

              F   C           G      C
    Under the sea / Under the sea
                 F                      G                    C     C7
    Darling it's better down where it's wetter, take it from me
              F                   G               Am               D7
    Up on the shore they work all day; out in the sun they slave away
               F                   G                   
    While we devoting full time to floating, under the sea

C     C     G      C
Down here all the fish is happy, as off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy - they sad 'cause they in their bowl
F     C     G      C
But fish in the bowl is lucky, they in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry - guess who's gon' be on the plate?

    Under the sea / Under the sea
    Nobody beat us, fry us and eat us in fricassee
    We what the land folks loves to cook, under the sea we off the hook
    We got no troubles, life is the bubbles
[G] Under the sea / Under the sea
    Since life is sweet here, we got the beat here, naturally
    Even the sturgeon and the ray, they get the urge and start to play
    We got the spirit, you got to hear it
    Under the sea

The newt play the flute / The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass / And they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass / The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul (Yeah)
The ray he can play / The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out / The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat / They know where it's at
An' oh that blowfish blow

Yeah, under the sea / Under the sea
When the sardine begin the beguine, it's music to me
What do they got? A lot of sand - we got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here know how to jam here, under the sea
Each little slug here cuttin' a rug here, under the sea
Each little snail here know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter under the water
Ya we in luck here down in the muck here, under the sea
