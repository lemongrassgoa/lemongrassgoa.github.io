Stitches

Bm    A    D    G
I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

         G    A    Bm   %   
LINK:    Got a feeling that I'm going under
         But I know that I'll make it out alive
         If I quit calling you my lover
         Move on
   
         Bm    A    D    G
REFRAIN: You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
         Shaking, falling onto my knees
         And now that I'm without your kisses
         I'll be needing stitches
         Tripping over myself
         Aching, begging you to come help
         And now that I'm without your kisses
         I'll be needing stitches

Bm    A    D    G
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Needle and the thread,
Gotta get you out of my head, get you out of my head
