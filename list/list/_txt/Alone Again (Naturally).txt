(VERSE 1)
GM7                    G6           Bm
In a little while from now / If I'm not feeling any less sour
  Dm                 Dm7                Bm(b5)         E7
I promised myself to treat myself / And visit a nearby tower
    Am                         Am(b5)
And climbing to the top / Will throw myself off
      G                 G+                  Em/G                       F#7
In an effort to make it clear to who / Ever what it's like when you're shattered
     Bm                          Dm                        E7
Left standing in the lurch, at a church / Where people are saying
   Am                                      Am(b5)
My God that's tough, she stood him up / No point in us remaining
GM7            G6        Bm          E7     Am        D7       GM7
May as well go home / As I did on my own / Alone again, naturally

   GM7                   G6          Bm
To think that only yesterday / I was cheerful, bright and gay
        Dm                  Dm7               Bm(b5)              E7
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do / The role I was about to play
       Am                      Am(b5)
But as if to knock me down / Reality came around
        G                G+                  Em/G        F#7
And without so much as a mere touch / Cut me into little pieces
Bm                         Dm               E7
Leaving me to doubt / Talk about God in his mercy
    Am                        Am(b5)
Who if he really does exist / Why did he desert me
GM7           G6        Bm         E7      Am        D7       GM7   Cm7-F7
In my hour of need? / I truly am indeed / Alone again, naturally

   Bb
It seems to me that / There are more hearts
F                                   Am(b5)    D7
Broken in the world / That can't be mended
         Bb    Em7(b5)       DM7            Am7    D7
Left unattended / What do we do? What do we do?

(instrumental) ... Alone again naturally

    GM7                   G6              Bm
Now looking back over the years / And whatever else that appears
    Dm                     Dm7                 Bm(b5)              E7
I remember I cried when my father died / Never wishing to hide the tears
       Am                        Am(b5)
And at sixty-five years old / My mother, God rest her soul
         G                  G+                 Em/G                F#7
Couldn't understand why the only man / She had ever loved had been taken
Bm                          Dm               E7
Leaving her to start with a heart / So badly broken
   Am                              Am(b5)
Despite encouragement from me / No words were ever spoken
    GM7              G6      Bm                  E7
And when she passed away / I cried and cried all day
 Am7       Am(b5)   Bm7  E7   Am7      Am7(b5)  D7    GM7
Alone again, naturally   /   Alone again,       naturally
