    When she was just a girl / She expected the world
    But it flew away from her reach / So she ran away in her sleep

|          Am          C          G           D
Dreamed of para- para- paradise / Para- para- paradise
           Para- para- paradise / Every time she closed her eyes

| Em   -   Cadd9   -  | G    -   D   -   |   x2
    Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh

    When she was just a girl / She expected the world
  |        C                  Em7             Em7                  D  
    But it flew away from her reach / And the bullets catch in her teeth
  | Am7               Cadd9               G                D
    Life goes on / It gets so heavy / The wheel breaks the butterfly
  | Cadd9         G
    Every tear, a waterfall
  |        C                 G                      D
    In the night, the stormy night / She closed her eyes
    In the night, the stormy night / Away she'd fly.

|            Am          C          G           D
And dream of para- para- paradise / Para- para- paradise
Para- para- paradise / Whoa-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Dream of para- para- paradise / Para- para- paradise
Para- para- paradise / Whoa-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

  | Am  -  D  - | Em  -  G   D   |   x3
    La la la La La la la

(single strums)
  |        C          G                  D
    and so lying underneath those stormy skies.
    She said oh-oh-oh-oh-oh / I know the sun must set to rise.

|             Am          C          G           D
This could be para- para- paradise / Para- para- paradise
Could be para- para- paradise / Whoa-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
This could be para- para- paradise / Para- para- paradise
Could be para- para- paradise / Whoa-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

(instrumental)

|             Am          C          G           D
This could be para- para- paradise / Para- para- paradise
Could be para- para- paradise / Whoa-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
This could be para- para- paradise / Para- para- paradise
Could be para- para- paradise / Whoa-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

    Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
