Imagine Dragons
Lonely

[Intro]
    N.C.
Sometimes, I can get a little
 
I can get a little lonely
    Dm           Em
Sometimes, I can get a little
      F            G
I can get a little lonely
 
 
[Verse 1]
     Dm       Em   F       G
Some nights I get a little lonely
     Dm   C                   Bb  A
It's even when there's people all around me
    Dm      Em    F      G
Sometimes I get a little anxious
             Dm              C            Bb         A
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    Dm                    Em
I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
                F                  G
Right on the brim, hand on a  limb, takin' it in
  Dm            C                           bb
Sleep it away, life in a day, no day in a life
             A
Mixin' it up, checkin' it twice
Bb
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
                A
Lights, camera, action and scene
              A
Story of my life
 
 
[Chorus]
      Dm          Em
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
       F                         G
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
     Dm          C
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
      Bb         A
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
              Dm          Em
I said oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
       F                         G
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
     Dm          C
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
      Bb         A
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
       N.C.
I said—
 
 
[Verse 2]
                       F             G
Sometimes, I smile to keep things easy
    Dm       C                 Bb     A
I hide in corners, hope that no one sees me
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         Dm                 Em                      F
So I'm playin' the role, ridin' the bull, stuck in a hole
             G
Takin' a bow, lookin' so proud
Dm                        C                  Bb
Look at me now, talkin' about pills in my mouth
                   A
Under the tongue, isn't it fun?
Bb
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
                C
Lights, camera, action and scene
            A
Story of my life, oh-oh
 
 
[Chorus]
      Dm          Em
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
       F                         G
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
     Dm          C
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
      Bb         A
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
            Dm          Em
I said oh love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
       F                         G
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
     Dm          C
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
      Bb         A
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
 
 
[Bridge]
               Dm                 Em              F             G
I said, "Oh, love" (Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
        Dm                     C              Bb
Have mercy (Help keep me company, I said, oh, love)
      A                          Dm     Em                                  F           G
Oh, love, can you please have mercy on me? (Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
        Dm            C
Can you keep me company? (Help keep me company, I said, help)
N.C.
L-O-N-E-L-Why am I so lonely?
 
 
[Chorus]
      Dm           Em
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
        F                         G
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
 
(Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
     Dm             C
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
    Bb            A
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
 
(Help keep me company, I said, oh, love)
      Dm           Em
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
        F                         G
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
 
(Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
     Dm             C
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
    Bb            A
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
 
(Help keep me company, I said, oh, love)
 
I said, oh—
