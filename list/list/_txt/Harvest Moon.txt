Neil Young
Harvest Moon

Come a little bit closer
Hear what I have to say
Just like children sleeping
We could dream the night away

But there's a full moon rising
Let's go dancing in the light
We know where music's playing
Let's go out and feel the night

Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon

When we were strangers
I watched you from afar
When we were lovers
I loved you with all my heart

But now it's getting late
And the moon is climbing high
I wanna celebrate
See it shining in your eyes

Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon
