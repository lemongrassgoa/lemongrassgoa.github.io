Breakfast At Tiffany's
Deep Blue Something

D           G         A          D
You'll say, we've got nothin' in common
   G      A         D
No common ground to start from
    Em7      A      D      G/B  A
And we're falling a-part
D               G         A       D
You'll say, the world has come between us
    G          A       D
Our lives have come between us
      Em7    A              D      G/B   A
Still I know you just don't care

    D          A     G
    And I said what about Breakfast at Tiffany's?
    She said I think I remember the film
    And as I recall I think, we both kind o' liked it
    And I said well that's, the one thing we've got

  D            G    A       D
I see you, the only one who knew me
    G        A        D
But now your eyes see through me
Em7  A           D      G/B  A
   I guess I was wrong
    D             G        A         D
So what now? It's plain to see we're over
      G         A          D
And I hate when things are over
     Em7        A       D      G/B   A
When so much is left un-done
