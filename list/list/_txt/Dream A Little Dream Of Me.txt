Dream A Little Dream Of Me (Sing in E, C capo 4)

| C     B7              G#   G
  Stars shining bright above you
| C     B7      Bb7     A7
  Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
| Dm                   Fm
  Birds singing in the sycamore tree
| C              G#       G
  Dream a little dream of me

| C    B7                 G#   G
  Say "Night-y night" and kiss me
| C    B7      Bb7       A7
  Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
| Dm                  Fm
  While I'm alone and blue as can be
| C              G#    G  C    E
  Dream a little dream of me

|   A     F#m        Bm       E
    Stars fading but I linger on, dear
    Still craving your kiss
    I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
|               G#   G
    Just saying this

| C    B7                 G#   G
  Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
| C    B7      Bb7       A7
  Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
| Dm                     Fm
  But in your dreams whatever they be
| C              G#    G  C    E
  Dream a little dream of me
