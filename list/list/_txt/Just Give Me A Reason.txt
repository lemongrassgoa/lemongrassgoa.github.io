Just Give Me A Reason

| Em   A   D   G   C   G/B   Am

| G     C  Em     C    G
Right from the start / You were a thief you stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me / that weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
| Em    A    D
Now you've been talking in your sleep (oh-oh)
Things you never say to me  (oh, oh)     |  C     G   Ds4 - D
Tell me that you've had enough / [G] Of our love, our love

    | G    D7(/F#)    Em    Bm  D7s4
    Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
    Just a second we're not broken just bent
    And we can learn to love again
    It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
    We're not broken just bent / And we can learn to love again

| G     C  Em     C    G
I'm sorry I don't understand / where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine (Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again, my dear we still have everything
And it's all in your mind (Yeah but this is happening)
| Em    A    D
You've been having real bad dreams (oh-oh)
You used to lie so close to me (oh-oh)
There's nothing more than empty sheets
[G] Between our [C] love, [G] our [Am] love
oh our [C] love, [G] our [Ds4] love

    | G    D7(/F#)    Em    Bm  D7s4
    Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
    Just a second we're not broken just bent
    And we can learn to love again
    I never stopped, it's been written in the scars on my heart
    We're not broken just bent / And we can learn to love again

| Em               Bm                     C
Oh tears ducts and rust / I'll fix it for us
|               D                         Em
We're collecting dust / but our love's enough
| Em              Bm                    C
You're holding it in / You're pouring a drink
| C              Am     Dsus4
No nothing is as bad as it seems (We'll come clean)

    | G    D7(/F#)    Em    Bm  D7s4
    Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
    Just a second we're not broken just bent
    And we can learn to love again
    It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
    We're not broken just bent / And we can learn to love again

    Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
    Just a second we're not broken just bent
    And we can learn to love again
    I never stopped, it's been written in the scars on my heart
    We're not broken just bent / And we can learn to love again

| G  D/F#                  Em   Bm            Dsus4
ohh, we can learn to love again / ohh, we can learn to love again
| G  D(7)   Em                             Bm                D7sus4
            Oh, that we're not broken just bent / and we can learn to love again
