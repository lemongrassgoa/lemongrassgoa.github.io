VERSE 1: Love of mine / someday you will die
       |             G                          D            A
         But I'll be close behind / I'll follow you into the dark
       |    D                            Bm
         No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
       |                G                          D                 A
         Just our hands clasped so tight / Waiting for the hint of a spark

REFRAIN: If Heaven and Hell decide / That they both are satisfied
       |   Bm            D              A
         Illuminate the "No"'s on their vacancy signs
       |    Bm               D                    F#     Bm    Bm/A
         If there's no one beside you / When your soul embarks
       |      G           Gm           D          |
         Then I'll follow you into the dark       |    (repeat for outro)
         
       |    D                               Bm
VERSE 2: In Catholic school / as vicious as Roman rule
       |          G                       D       A
         I got my knuckles bruised / by a lady in black
       |       D                       Bm
         And I held my tongue / as she told me, "Son,
       |             G                      D          A
         Fear is the heart of love." / So I never went back

VERSE 3: You and me / have seen everything to see
       |                 G                 D             A
         From Bangkok to Calgary / And the soles of your shoes
       |     D                            Bm
         Are all worn down / The time for sleep is now
       |                 G                        D               A
         It's nothing to cry about / 'Cause we'll hold each other soon
       |        Bm          G
         In the blackest of rooms
