While My Guitar Gently Weeps

  Dm          Dm/C        Dm/B              Dm/Bb      Dm          C          G      A
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping / While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping / Still my guitar gently [F]weeps  [A]

D            F#m  Bm          F#m   Em7                A
I don't know why  nobody told you / How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you / They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it's turning / While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning / Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted / You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted / No one alerted you

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping / While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all / Still my guitar gently weeps

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh
