She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one
who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, be careful what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (hee)
And mother always told me, be careful  who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth

    Billie Jean is not my lover
    She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
    But the kid is not my son
    She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans
'cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice

She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
She showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes looked like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me, be careful  what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts (hee)
She came and stood right by me / Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon / She called me to her room

    Billie Jean is not my lover
    She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
    But the kid is not my son

    Billie Jean is not my lover
    She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
    But the kid is not my son
    She says I am the one
    But the kid is not my son+

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one
she says he is my son
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
