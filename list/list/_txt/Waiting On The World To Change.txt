Waiting On The World To Change

D    Bm    G    D   []   A    Bm    G    D 
Me and all my friends / We're all misunderstood 
They say we stand for nothing and / There's no way we ever could 
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it 
We just feel like we don't have the means 
To rise above and beat it 

D    Bm    G    D   []   A    Bm    G    D 
So we keep waiting / Waiting on the world to change 
We keep on waiting / Waiting on the world to change
D   Em   Bm   Em7   []   A    Bm    G    D 
It's hard to beat the system / When we're standing at a distance 
So we keep waiting / Waiting on the world to change 

D    Bm    G    D   []   A    Bm    G    D 
Now if we had the power / To bring our neighbors home from war 
They would have never missed a Christmas / No more ribbons on their door 
And when you trust your television / What you get is what you got 
Cause when they own the information, oh / They can bend it all they want 

D    Bm    G    D   []   A    Bm    G    D 
That's why we're waiting / Waiting on the world to change 
We keep on waiting / Waiting on the world to change 
D   Em   Bm   Em7   []   A    Bm    G    D 
It's not that we don't care / We just know that the fight ain't fair 
So we keep on waiting / Waiting on the world to change

D    Bm    G    D   []   A    Bm    G    D 

D    Bm    G    D   []   A    Bm    G    D 
And we're still waiting / Waiting on the world to change 
We keep on waiting / waiting on the world to change 
One day our generation / Is gonna rule the population 
So we keep on waiting / Waiting on the world to change 
We keep on waiting / Waiting on the world to change
