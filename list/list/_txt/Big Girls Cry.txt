Big Girls Cry

         Em    G    D    Am7
VERSE 1: Tough girl / In the fast lane
         No time for love / No time for hate
         No drama no time / For games
         Tough girl / Whose soul aches

LINK:    I'm at home, On my own
         Check my phone, Nothing though
         CM7    Em    B7s4    B7
         Act busy, Order in
         Pay TV, It's agony

REFRAIN: I may cry, ruining my makeup
         Wash away all the things you've taken
         And I don't care if I don't look pretty
         Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
         Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
         Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
         
VERSE 2: Tough girl / I'm in pain
         It's lonely at the top / Blackouts and airplanes
         I still pour you a glass of champagne
         Tough girl / Whose soul aches

         I wake up, I wake up, I wake up
         I wake up, I wake up, I wake up
         I wake up, I wake up, I wake up
         I wake up, I wake up, I wake up,
         I wake up alone
