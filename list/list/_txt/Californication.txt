Californication (orig Am) [drum: Groove Beat 1, bpm: 100]

[ Am         F ]
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
Little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotations
|   C                 G                     F        Dm
And if you want these kind of dreams / It's Californication

[ Am         F ]
It's the edge of the world and all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the East at least it's settled in the final location
|    C               G                 F        Dm
It's understood that Hollywood / Sells Californication

    [ Am         F ]
    Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
    Celebrity skin - is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
    First born unicorn / Hard core soft porn
|   C            G    Dm    Am   C            G    Dm
    Dream of Californication  /  Dream of Californication ...

[ Am         F ]
Marry me girl be my fairy to the world / be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
|   C                    G                F        Dm
And buy me a star on the boulevard / It's Californication

[ Am         F ]
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
Cobain can you hear the spheres singing songs off station to station
|   C              G               F        Dm
And Alderaan's not far away / It's Californication

    [ Am         F ]
    Born and raised by those who praise control of population 
    Everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation
    First born unicorn / Hard core soft porn
|   C            G    Dm    Am   C            G    Dm

[ Am         F ]
Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
|   C                    G                   F        Dm
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

    [ Am         F ]
    Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
