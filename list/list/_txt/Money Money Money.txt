Dm                                  A7/C#
I work all night, I work all day to pay the bills I have to pay
A7       Dm
Ain't it sad?
Dm                                  A7/C#
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
A7         Dm
That's too bad
Dm                           Bb
In my dreams I have a plan / If I got me a wealthy man
  Gm                            E7/G#                           A
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball ...

    Dm                  E7              A7                  Dm
    Money, money, money / Must be funny / In the rich man's world
    Money, money, money / Always sunny  / In the rich man's world
      Gm   A7    D7                       Gm
    A-ha - a   /   All the things I could do
    Bb7   A7   Dm                 Gm7      A7         Dm   (intro)  E7
    If    I    had a little money / It's a rich man's world
    Gm7      A7         Dm
      It's a rich man's world

Dm                                  A7/C#
A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
A7       Dm
Ain't it sad?
Dm                             A7/C#
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me
A7         Dm
That's too bad
   Dm                            Bb
So I must leave, I'll have to go / To Las Vegas or Monaco
    Gm                          E7/G#                         A
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same

    Dm                  E7              A7                  Dm
    Money, money, money / Must be funny / In the rich man's world
