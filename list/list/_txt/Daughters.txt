INTRO: | Bm7    Em7    A7s4    DM7

| Bm7    Em7    A7s4    DM7
I know a girl / She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

|   Bm7   E7   A7s4   DM7
    Fathers, be good to your daughters
    Daughters will love like you do
    Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
    So mothers, be good to your daughters too

| Bm7    Em7    A7s4    DM7
Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left / Cleaning up the mess he made

|    Bm7   E7   A7s4   DM7
    Fathers, be good to your daughters
    Daughters will love like you do
    Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
    So mothers, be good to your daughters too

| D9   Gm/D     D           A7s4                       Bm7
  Boys, you can break / You find out how much they can take
|            Em7                       D/F#
Boys will be strong / And boys soldier on
|                 Gm11
But boys would be gone without the warmth from
| As4
A woman's good, good heart

| Bm7   E7   A7s4   DM7
On behalf of every man / Looking out for every girl
You are the god and the weight of her world

|   Bm7   E7   A7s4   DM7
    Fathers, be good to your daughters
    Daughters will love like you do
    Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
    So mothers, be good to your daughters too
