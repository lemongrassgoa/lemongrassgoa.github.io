A Sky Full Of Stars (orig. Eb)

| Dm - - - | BbM7 - - - | F - - - | Am7 - - - |

'Cause you're a sky
'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart

'Cause you're a sky
'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path

    I don't care, go on and tear me apart
    I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
    'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
    I think I saw you

[beat]
| Dm - - - | BbM7 - - - | F - - - | Am7 - - - | x2

| Dm - - - | BbM7 - - - | F - - - | Am7 - - - |
'Cause you're a sky
'cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms, oh, oh-oh

'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart, oh

    I don't care, go on and tear me apart
    I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
    'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
    I think I see you
    I think I see you

Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
