Come away with me
Norah Jones (Capo 5)

G     Em7                G     Em7
Come away with me in the night
G     Em7
Come away with me
        Bm       C(add9)  G    Em7
And I will write you a song

G     Em7               G    Em7
Come away with me on a bus
G     Em7            Bm          C(add9)
Come away where they can't tempt us
         G
With their lies


D           C(add9)              G
I want to walk with you
G                                   D
On a cloudy day
D                   C(add9)         G
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
D                     G
So won't you try to come

G     Em7                    G     Em7
Come away with me and we'll kiss
Em7
On a mountaintop
G     Em7
Come away with me
      Bm       C(add9)      G
And I'll never stop loving you


D             C(add9)            G
And I want to wake up with the rain
G
Falling on a tin roof
D         C(add9)             G
While I'm safe there in your arms
             D       G
So all I ask is for you
G        Em7                   G     Em7
To come away with me in the night
G    D          G
Come away with me
