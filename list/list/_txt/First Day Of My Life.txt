First Day Of My Life
Bright Eyes (capo 2)

INTRO: | D   F#7   Bm  /  G   A   D     |  x2

| D         F#7             Bm
This is the first day of my life
| G         A                 D
Swear I was born right in the doorway
| D               F#7                       Bm
I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
|                   E7              A
They're spreading / blankets on the beach

| D          F#7               Bm
Yours is the first face that I saw
| G           A              D
I think I was blind before I met you
| D                      F#7                         Bm
Now I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've been
|            E7              A
But I know / where I want to go

|            D           A/C#    Bm          G                 A
    And so I thought I'd let you know / That these things take forever
|      D       F#m7/C#  Bm           Em
    I especial-ly   am  slow / But I realize that I need you
|         Em                       D    F#7    Bm     /  Em    Gm
    And I wondered if I could come home

| D          F#7                Bm
Remember the time you drove all night
| G     A              D
Just to meet me in the morning
| D                  F#7                         Bm
And I thought it was strange you said everything changed
|           E7                 A
You felt as if you'd just woke up / And you said

| D         F#7             Bm
This is the first day of my life
| G               A                D
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you
| D             F#7                Bm
But now I don't care I could go anywhere with you
|       E7             A
And I'd probably be happy

|         D       A/C#    Bm        G                       A
So if you want to be with me / With these things there's no telling
|       D       F#m/C#   Bm                      Em
We just have to wait and see / But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
|    Em                       D       F#7      Bm
Than waiting to win the lottery
|       Em                                                              D   ...
Besides maybe this time it's different / I mean I really think you like me

| D    F#7    Bm     /    Em    Gm     |  x2
