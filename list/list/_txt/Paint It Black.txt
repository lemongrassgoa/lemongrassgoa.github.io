Paint It Black (orig Fm)

INTRO: Em

    | Em                   B
    I see a red door and I want it painted black
    No colors anymore, I want them to turn black

| Em  -  D  -  G  -  D  |   Em
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
| Em  -  D  -  G  -  D  |   A - - - B - - -
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

    | Em                   B
    I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
    With flowers and my love, both never to come back

| Em  -  D  -  G  -  D  |   Em
I've seen people turn their heads and quickly look away
| Em  -  D  -  G  -  D  |   A - - - B - - -
Like a newborn baby, it just happens everyday

    | Em                   B
    I look inside myself and see my heart is black
    I see my red door, I must have it painted black

| Em  -  D  -  G  -  D  |   Em
Maybe then, I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
| Em  -  D  -  G  -  D  |   A - - - B - - -
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

    (single strums)
    | Em                   B
    No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
    I could not foresee this thing happening to you

| Em  -  D  -  G  -  D  |   Em
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
| Em  -  D  -  G  -  D  |   A - - - B - - -
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

    | Em                   B
    I see a red door and I want it painted black
    No colors anymore, I want them to turn black

| Em  -  D  -  G  -  D  |   Em
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
| Em  -  D  -  G  -  D  |   A - - - B - - -
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

| Em                   B
Mmmm-mmm-mmm ....

| Em                   B
I wanna see it painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun, blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted
Painted black, yeah
