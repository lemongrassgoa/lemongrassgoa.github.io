Watermelon Sugar
Harry Styles [rhythm: Groove 1, bpm: 100]

Tastes like strawberries / On a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries / And that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm

Breathe me in / Breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high x4
Watermelon sugar

Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly / And that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you
Breathe me in / Breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high x8

I just wanna taste it
I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high

Tastes like strawberries / On a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries / And that summer feelin'
I don't know if I could ever go without
