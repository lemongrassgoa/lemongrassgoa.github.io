George Ezra
Shotgun

Homegrown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar / I could get used to this

  Time flies by in the yellow and green
  Stick around and you'll see what I mean
  There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
  If you need me you know where I'll be

    I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
    Feeling like a someone (someone)
    I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
    Feeling like a someone

We're south of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Deep sea diving 'round the clock, bikini bottoms, lager tops
I could get used to this

  Time flies by in the yellow and green
  Stick around and you'll see what I mean
  There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
  If you need me you know where I'll be

    I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
    Feeling like a someone (someone)
    I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
    Feeling like a someone

We got two in the front / Two in the back (hey)
Sailing along, And we don't look back (back, back)

  Time flies by in the yellow and green
  Stick around and you'll see what I mean
  There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
  If you need me you know where I'll be

    I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
    Feeling like a someone (someone)
    I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
    Feeling like a someone
    
    I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
    Feeling like a someone (someone)
    I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
    Feeling like a someone, a someone, a someone, someone
