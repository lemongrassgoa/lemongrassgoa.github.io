Simone / You're getting older
Your journey's been / etched on your skin
|Em      Em7      C      D   B7
Simone / Wish I had known that
What seemed so strong / Has been and gone

|   Em     Em7     C     G  D
    I would call you up every Sunday night
    And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
    And we sang / "Here we go again"
    And though time goes by, I will always be
    In a club with you / In 1973
    Singing "Here we go again"

| Em      Em7      C      G   D
Simone / Wish I was sober
So I could see clearly now / The rain has gone
| Em      Em7      C      D   B7
Simone / I guess it's over 
My memory plays our tune / The same old song

|   Em     Em7     C     G  D
    I would call you up every Sunday night
    And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
    And we sang / "Here we go again"
    And though time goes by, I will always be
    In a club with you / In 1973
    Singing "Here we go again"
