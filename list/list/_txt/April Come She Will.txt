April Come She Will
Simon and Garfunkel

| G(s)   D     G   C/G

| G
April come she will
| Am   Am/G   Am/F   Em
When streams are ripe and swelled with rain;
| C    D     G    Em
May, she will stay,
| Am   Em    Am   Em
Resting in my arms again.

| G
June, she'll change her tune,
| Am   Am/G   Am/F   Em
In restless walks she'll prowl the night;
| C    D     G    Em
July, she will fly
| Am   Em    Am   Em
And give no warning to her flight.

| G
August, die she must, 
| Am   Am/G   Am/F   Em
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold;
| C    D     G    Em
September I'll remember
| Am   Em    D    G
A love once new has now grown old.
