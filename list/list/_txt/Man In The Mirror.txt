Michael Jackson
Man In The Mirror

I'm gonna make a change / for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good / gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on / my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street / with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind / pretending not to see their needs?

A summer's disregard / a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind you know
'Cause they got nowhere to go / that's why I want you to know

    I'm starting with the man in the mirror
    I'm asking him to change his ways
    And no message could have been any clearer
    If you wanna make the world a better place
    Take a look at yourself and then make a change

    Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

I've been a victim of / a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home / not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me / pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred / somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, you see
'Cause they got no place to be / that's why I'm starting with me

    I'm starting with the man in the mirror
    I'm asking him to change his ways
    And no message could have been any clearer
    If you wanna make the world a better place
    Take a look at yourself and then make a change

    I'm starting with the man in the mirror
    I'm asking him to change his ways
    And no message could have been any clearer
    If you wanna make the world a better place
    Take a look at yourself and then make that ... change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways
('Cause you better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change

You gotta get it right
While you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart

You can't close your your mind
(Then you close your mind!)

That man, that man, that man, that man
With the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
You know that man
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Hoo, hoo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana), hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)

Oh, no, oh, no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good

You've got to stop it yourself

You got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo
(Yeah! Make that change!)
You know

(Man in the mirror)
You've got to
You've got to move
Shamone, shamone
You got to stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
(Yeah. Make that change)
Stand up and lift yourself now
