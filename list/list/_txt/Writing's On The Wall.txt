Writing's On The Wall

Fm7              G#M7
I've been here before
But always hit the floor
[C#M7] I've spent a lifetime running
[C7]   And I always get away
[C#M7] But with you I'm feeling something
[C7]   That makes me want to stay
Fm7              G#M7
I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
[C#M7] But I feel like a storm is coming
[C7]   If I'm gonna make it through the day
[C#M7] Then there's no more use in running
[C7]   This is something I gotta face

If I risk it all
Fm    G#    D7   %
Could you break my fall?

How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall

A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall
The writing's on the wall

How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall
