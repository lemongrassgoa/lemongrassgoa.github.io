I Won't Give Up

When I look into your eyes, It's like watching the night sky,
Or a beautiful sunrise. There's so much they hold.
And just like them old stars, I see that you've come so far,
To be right where you are. How old is your soul?
 
    |            A     E                 C#m       B
    I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough.
    |              A      E                       Bsus4  B
    I'm giving you all my love. I'm still looking up.
     
|   A - E(s4)   ......   B(s4)
And when you're needing your space, to do some navigating,
I'll be here patiently waiting, to see what you find.
     
    |               A          E               C#m         B
    'Cause even the stars they burn. Some even fall to the earth.

    We've got a lot to learn. God knows we're worth it.

    No, I won't give up.
 
I don't [F#m] wanna be someone who walks away so easily,
I'm here to stay and make the difference that [B] I can make.
Our [F#m] differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
the tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a [B] lot at stake.

And in the [D] end you're still my friend, at least we did intend
for us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn.
[Eb-] We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in.
| D                          Eb-             N.C.       E
  I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not and who I am.
 
    |            A     E               C#m       B
    I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough.
    |              A       E                      C#m7
    I'm giving you all my love, I'm still looking up.
    |             B
    Still looking up.
     
    |            A     E
    I won't give up on us (no I'm not... giving up)
    |             C#m     B
    God knows I'm tough e-nough (I am tough... I am loved)
    |           A      E
    We've got a lot to learn (we're alive... we are loved)
    |               B
    God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)
     
    |            A     E               C#m       B
    I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough.
    |              A      E                       B
    I'm giving you all my love. I'm still looking up.
