Viva La Vida
Coldplay (orig capo 1)

(INTRO)
C   D7sus4   G   Em   |  x2

(VERSE ½)
I used to rule the world / Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone / Sweep the streets I used to own

(intro theme)

(VERSE 1)
I used to roll the dice / Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing / "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key / Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand / Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

(REFRAIN 1)
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing / Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield / My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain / Once you go there was never
Never an honest word / And that was when I ruled the world

(intro theme)

(VERSE 2)
It was the wicked and wild wind / Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums / People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait / For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string / Oh, who would ever wanna be king?

(REFRAIN 2)
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing / Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield / My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain / I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word / But that was when I ruled the world

C   Em   |  x3
