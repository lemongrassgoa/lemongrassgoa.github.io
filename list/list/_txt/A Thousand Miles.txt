Vanessa Carlton
A Thousand Miles (orig Capo 4) [rhythm: Groove 1, bpm: 95]

| Cadd2  -  Ds4      G/B  -  Cadd2
Making my way down-town,  walking fast
faces pass, and I'm home bound
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

    And I need you
    And I miss you
    And now I [Cadd2]won-[D]der

    If I could fall / into the sky
    Do you think time / would pass me by
    'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
    If I could [Em]just [D/F#]see [D]you / tonight

It's always times like these when I think of you
And I wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong, and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory

    'Cause I need you
    And I miss you
    And now I [Cadd2]won-[D]der

    If I could fall / into the sky
    Do you think time / would pass me by
    'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
    If I could [Em]just [D/F#]see [D]you / tonight

Em      D/F#        G       Am7
And I, I ... don't want to let you go
I, I ... drown in your memory
I, I ... don't want to let this go
| Em7   D/F#    Ds4
  I,    I       don't....

Making my way downtown, walking fast
faces pass, and I'm home bound
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

    'Cause I still need you
    And I still miss you
    And now I [Cadd2]won-[D]der ...

    If I could fall / into the sky
    Do you think time / would pass me by
    'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
    If I could [Em]just [D/F#]see [D]you, ohh ....
    
    If I could fall / into the sky
    Do you think time / would pass me by
    'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
    If I could [Em]just [D/F#]see [D]you 
    If I could [Em]just [D/F#]hold [D]you
    tonight
