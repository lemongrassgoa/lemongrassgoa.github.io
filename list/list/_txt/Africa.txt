I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in twelve-thirty flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars
that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say:
"Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you" 
                 [G     F#m  Bm ....]

|   Em                Cadd9           G        D
    It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
    There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
    I bless the rains down in Africa
|   Em              Cadd9
    Gonna take some time to do the
|   G               Bm   D   Em   D/F#
    things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
frightened of this thing that I've become
                   [G     F#m  Bm ....]

|   Em                Cadd9           G        D
    It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
    There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
    I bless the rains down in Africa
|   Em              Cadd9
    Gonna take some time to do the
|   G               Bm   D   Em   D/F#
