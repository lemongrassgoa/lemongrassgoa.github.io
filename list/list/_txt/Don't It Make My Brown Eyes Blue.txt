Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue
Crystal Gayle (orig F#)

F     Dm     Gm7     C7s4
Don't know when I've been so blue
F     Dm     Gm6     A7
Don't know what's come over you
Dm    Dm/C   Bm7b5   (G7)
You've found someone new
Bb    Am     Gm7     C7s4  
And don't it make my brown eyes blue

F     Dm     Gm7     C7s4
I'll be fine when you're gone
F     Dm     Gm6     A7
I'll just cry all night long
Dm    Dm/C   Bm7b5   (G7)
Say it isn't true
Bb    C7s4   F      %  
And don't it make my brown eyes blue

Dm    Am    Bb    F/C
Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies
Give me no reasons, give me alibis
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Gm7    Am    Bb    C7s4
Say anything but don't say goodbye

F     Dm     Gm7     C7s4
I didn't mean to treat you bad
F     Dm     Gm6     A7
Didn't know just what I had
Dm    Dm/C   Bm7b5   (G7)
But, honey, now I do
Bb    Am
And don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes
Bb    C7s4    F (intro theme)
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
