Ricky Martin
She Bangs [rhythm: 909 Clap, bpm: 145]

Talk to me, tell me your name
You blow me off like it's all the same
You lit a fuse, and now I'm ticking away
Like a bomb yeah baby

    Talk to me, tell me your sign
    You're switchin' sides like a Gemini
    You're playing games and now you're hittin' my heart
    Like a drum yeah baby

Well if Lady Luck gets on my side
We're gonna rock this town alive
I'll let her rough me up
'Til she knocks me out
'Cause she walks like she talks
And she talks like she walks

    She bangs, she bangs
    Oh baby
    When she moves, she moves
    I go crazy
    'Cause she looks like a flower
    But she stings like a bee
    Like every girl in history

    She bangs, she bangs
    I'm wasted by the way she moves she moves
    No one ever looked so fine
    She reminds me
    That a woman's got one thing on her mind

Talk to me, tell me your name
I'm just a link in your daisy chain
You rap sounds like a diamond map to the stars
Yeah baby

    Talk to me, tell me the news
    You'll wear me out like a pair of shoes
    We'll dance until the band goes home
    Then you're gone yeah baby

Well, if it looks like love should be a crime
They better lock me up for life
I'll do the time with a smile on my face
Thinkin' of her in her leather and lace

    She bangs, she bangs
    Oh baby
    When she moves, she moves
    I go crazy
    'Cause she looks like a flower
    But she stings like a bee
    Like every girl in history

    She bangs, she bangs
    I'm wasted by the way she moves she moves
    No one ever looked so fine
    She reminds me
    That a woman's got one thing on her mind

Man, if Lady Luck gets on my side
We're gonna rock this town alive
I'll let her rough me up
'Til she knocks me out
'Cause she walks like she talks
And she talks like she walks

    She bangs, she bangs
    Oh baby
    When she moves, she moves
    I go crazy
    'Cause she looks like a flower
    But she stings like a bee
    Like every girl in history

She bangs, she bangs
I'm wasted by the way she moves
No one ever looked so fine
She reminds me
That a woman's got one thing on her mind

She bangs, she bangs (ohhh)
She moves, she moves

She bangs, she bangs
She moves, she moves
