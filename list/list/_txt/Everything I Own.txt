    You sheltered me from harm  /  Kept me warm, kept me warm
    You gave my life to me / Set me free, set me free

    The finest years I ever knew  /  Were all the years I had with you

|   G            D     Em      A     G          D        Em        A

    You taught me how to love / What it's of, what it's of
    You never said too much but still you showed the way
|     C   G              D
    And I knew from watching you
| Em         G            A(sus)  Em            G                A
    Nobody else could ever know / The part of me that can't let go

Is there someone you know / You're loving them so

But taking them all for granted
| F#m     Em                          Em/D
You may lose them one day / Someone takes them away
|        C                                A
And they don't hear the words you long to say

|   G            D     Em      A     G          D        Em        A
And I would give any - thing I own / Give up my life, my heart, my home
    I would give every thing I own / Just to have you back again
