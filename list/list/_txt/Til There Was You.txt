Til There Was You
The Beatles

|          F          D7/F#        Gm               Bbm
There were bells on a hill / But I never heard them ringing
|     F     Am    Abm     Gm7   C7            F      C+
No, I never heard them at all / Til there was you

|          F            D7/F#       Gm             Bbm
There were birds in the sky / But I never saw them winging
|     F     Am  Abm     Gm7   C7            F     F7
No, I never saw them at all / Til there was you

    |              Bb  Bbm             F
    Then there was music and wonderful roses
    |    D7         Gm             G7           C7       C+
    They send me in sweet fragrant meadows / Of dawn and dew

|         F         D7/F#         Gm             Bbm
There was love all around / But I never heard it singing
|     F     Am7   Abm7  Gm7   C7            F    (F7)
No, I never heard it at all / Til there was you

    Then there was music and wonderful roses
    |    D7         Gm             G7           C7       C+
    They send me in sweet fragrant meadows / Of dawn and dew

|         F         D7/F#         Gm             Bbm
There was love all around / But I never heard it singing
