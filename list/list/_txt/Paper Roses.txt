Paper Roses
Anita Bryant

G     D7
I realize the way your eyes deceived me
D7    G
with tender looks that I mistook for love
G     C
So take away the flowers that you gave me
D(7)  G                              (G7)
And send the kind that you remind me of

    C      %      G     %
    Paper roses / Paper roses
    D7    (D+)    G     (G7)
    Oh, how real those roses seem to be
    C      %      G      Em
    But they're only imitation
    Am     D7     G      %
    Like your imitation love for me

I thought that you would be a perfect lover
You seemed so full of sweetness at the start
But like a big red rose that's made of paper
There isn't any sweetness in your heart
