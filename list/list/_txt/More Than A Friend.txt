More Than A Friend (orig A)

G   C   D   Am7

G          C            D        Am7
You got me counting the seconds
G          C     D
It happens every time
Em                  A7
I'm waiting for the moment
       Am7                     D       C - D
we can sit down and talk for a while
G         C                D        Am7
And every time that you're near me
G           C        D
my heart is running away
          Em                             A7
How can I tell you when words don't come easy
             Am7                   D
and there is so much I'm trying to say 

            G         C         D          Am7
    I wanna know that love will surround us
                 G             C        D       B7/D#
    and you will share it with me every day
                   Em                  A7
    Tell me you'll care for me now and forever
              Am7                  D7s4
    I'll give anything to hear you say
                           G    C    D    Am7
    that I'm more than a friend 

G         C          D       Am7
I'm gonna try in the future
G      C           D
not to live in the past
Em                   A7
I guess that I was a dreamer
     Am7                   D    C - D
if I thought it could ever last
G         C           D       Am7
But every time that I see you
G            C          D
you bring me out in the sun
          Em                    A7
How can I hide it when we are together
       C                         D
I just know that you're the only one 

            G         C         D
    I wanna know that love will surround us
    Am7          G             C        D
    and you will share it with me every day
    B7/D#          Em                  A7
    Tell me you'll care for me now and forever
              Am7                  D7s4
    I'll give anything to hear you say
                         G         C - G
    that I'm more than a friend

        C                Am7                  G           G
BRIDGE: I wanna make you see / everything you are to me
                    C                       Am7

                            F                    D
