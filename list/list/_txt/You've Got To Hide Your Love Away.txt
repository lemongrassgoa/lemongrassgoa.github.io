You've Got To Hide Your Love Away
The Beatles

| G      D     F       G
  Here I stand head in hand
| C                   F      C
  Turn my face to the wall
| G        D      F        G
  If she's gone I can't go on
| C                F     C   D
  Feeling two-foot sma - a - all
  
| G    D     F      G
  Everywhere people stare
| C              F      C
  Each and every day
| G     D        F        G
  I can see them laugh at me
| C               F    C   D   /C  /B  /A
  And I hear them sa - a - ay 

  | G                  C                D
    Hey! You've got to hide your love a-way
    Hey! You've got to hide your love a-way

| G       D   F    G
  How can I   even try
| C           F     C
  I can never win
| G       D     F      G
  Hearing them, seeing them
| C                F    C    D
  In the state I'm i -  i  - in
  
| G         D   F      G
  How could she say to me
| C                F    C
  Love will find a way
| G      D     F       G
  Gather round all you clowns
| C               F    C   D   /C  /B  /A
  Let me hear you sa - a - ay 

  | G                  C                D
    Hey! You've got to hide your love a-way
    Hey! You've got to hide your love a-way

  | G                  C                D
    Hey! You've got to hide your love a-way
    Hey! You've got to hide your love a-way
    
  | N.C.               C                D
    Hey! You've got to hide your love a-way
