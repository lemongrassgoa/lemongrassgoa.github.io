You Will Never Know

INTRO:   Bm   F#m

VERSE 1: It breaks my heart 'cause I know you're the one for me
         Don't you feel sad there never was a story
         Obviously / it never be
         
REFRAIN: You will never know / I will never show    |
         What I feel / What I need from you no      |   x2
         
VERSE 2: With every smile comes my reality irony
         You won't find out what has been killing me
         Can't you see me, can't you see?
         
         You will never know / I will never show
         What I feel / What I need from you no
         You will never know / I will never show
         What I feel / What I need from you
         No no no no you will never know / I will never show
         What I feel / What I need from you no
         
         No no no no you'll never know
         No no no no you'll never know
         No no no no
         Love me love me love me love me no
         
         You will never know
         I will never show no no no
         What I feel
         What I need from you no no no
         You will never know
         I will never show no no no
         What I feel
         What I feel
         What I feel
         What I need
         What I need from you no.
