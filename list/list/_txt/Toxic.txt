Toxic [drum: Simple 4, bpm: 140]

|(intro riff)    Am

|N.C.               Am
Baby, can't you see / I'm calling?
A guy like you / should wear a warning
|C              E            Am (riff)
It's dangerous, I'm falling
|Am
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
|C               E              Am (riff)
You're dangerous, I'm loving it

|    Am
    Too high, can't come down
    Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
|    C     E                      Am (riff) (N.C. 8 beats)
        ...  Do you feel me now?

|          Am                      C7
    With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
|   B7              Bb7
      You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
|          Am                C7
    With a taste of a poison paradise
|         FM7  (riff)
    I'm addicted to you
|	          E7               Bb7     Am      C7
    Don't you know that you're toxic?
|         B7
    And I love what you do
|	          Bb7no5                   Am      C7

|FM7 (riff)      E7 - Bb7
 
|N.C.               Am
It's getting late / to give you up
I took a sip / from my devil's cup
|C            E             Am (riff backwards)
Slowly, it's taking over me

|   Am
    Too high, can't come down
    It's in the air and it's all around
|    C     E7                      Am (riff) (N.C. 8 beats)
        ...  Can you feel me now?
