Someone told me long ago / there's a calm before the storm
I know / it's been comin' for some time
When it's over, so they say / it'll rain a sunny day
I know, shinin' down like water

    | F       G               C    C/B      Am   G
    I want to know / have you ever seen the rain?
    I want to know / have you ever seen the rain
    | F    G               C
    Comin' down on a sunny day? 

| C       G    C
Yesterday and days before / sun is cold and rain is hard
I know / been that way for all my time
Till forever, on it goes / through the circle, fast and slow
I know / it can't stop, I wonder

    | F       G               C    C/B      Am   G
    I want to know / have you ever seen the rain?
    I want to know / have you ever seen the rain
    | F    G               C
    Comin' down on a sunny day?
