Paolo Nutini
New Shoes (orig A) [rhythm: Simple 4, bpm: 150]

| A                     Cadd9                    G
Woke up cold one Tuesday / I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
| A                                             Cadd9      E
I felt like there was something missing / in my day to day life
|    A                         Cadd9                           G
So I quickly opened the wardrobe / Pulled out some jeans and a t-shirt that seemed clean
| A                                                Cadd9             E
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes / That were ripped around the seams
[Ds2] And I thought these shoes just don't suit me

|   A               E                  Ds2   
    Hey, I put some new shoes on / And suddenly everything is right
    I said, hey I put some new shoes on / And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
    Oh short on money but long on time / Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
    And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse / 'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

| A                                 Cadd9               G
Woke up late one Thursday / And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes and I
| A                                          Cadd9          E
Felt like there were two days missing / As I focused on the time
|     A                                  Cadd9                G
And I made my way to the kitchen / But I had to stop from the shock of what I found
| A                                   Cadd9             E
A room full of all my friends all are dancing round and round
[Ds2] And I thought hello new shoes / Bye bye blues

|   A               E                  Ds2   
    Hey, I put some new shoes on / And suddenly everything is right
    I said, hey I put some new shoes on / And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
    Oh short on money but long on time / Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
    And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse / 'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
    
[A]   Take me wandering through these streets       \  
[A]   Where bright lights and angels meet [Cadd9]   |  
[A]   Stone to stone they take me on                |  x2
[Ds2] I'm walking 'til the break of dawn            /  

|   A               E                  Ds2   
    Hey, I put some new shoes on / And suddenly everything is right
    I said, hey I put some new shoes on / And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
    Oh short on money but long on time / Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
    And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse / 'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

|   A               E                  Ds2   
    Hey, I put some new shoes on / And suddenly everything is right
    I said, hey I put some new shoes on / And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
    Oh short on money but long on time / Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
    And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse / 'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
