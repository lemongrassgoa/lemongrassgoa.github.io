Til You're Home acoustic (orig E)

|  E  -  Bs4  -  |  C#m7  -  As2  -  |
Sun through the shadows / Light through the door
Voice like an echo / I can't hear anymore

|  Bs4  -  C#m7  -  |  E  -  As2  -  | 
So I follow your steps
While the love that you left / Is burned in my heart
With dreams in my mind
Of the next time that I / Have you in my arms

    |  E  -  As2  -  |  Bs4  -  B   -  |
    'Cause I will tell you the whole truth
    That there's no color in the world without you
    |  E  -  As2  -  |  C#m7  Bs4  As2  E/G#  |
    And I finally see that your love is the best of me
    |  As2  E/G#  |  C#m7  -  -  -  |
    Yeah there's so much I want you to know
    |  E  As2  Bs4  -  |  C#m7  -  As2  -  |
    Guess I'll wait til you're home

|  E  -  Bs4  -  |  C#m7  -  As2  -  |
The way that you smile / When you think you're alone
The best gift of this life / Is to see you up close

|  Bs4  -  C#m7  -  |  E  -  As2  -  | 
Now and again
In the palm of my hand / I feel your touch
So I write it all down
All these moments I've found / Till I see you my love

    |  E  -  As2  -  |  Bs4  -  B   -  |
    And I will tell you the whole truth
    That there's no color in the world without you
    |  E  -  As2  -  |  C#m7  Bs4  As2  E/G#  |
    And I finally see how your love is the best of me
    |  As2  E/G#  |  C#m7  -  -  -  |
    Yeah there's so much I want you to know
    |  C#m7  Bs4  As2  E/G#  |  As2  -  -  -  |
    Yeah there's so much I want you to know
    |  E  -  Bs4  -  |  C#m7  -  As2  -  |  E
    Guess I'll wait til you're home
