|         E    G#m     F#m7    C#m
There's a port    on a western bay
|      F#m     A           D       A
And it serves     a hundred ships a day
|      E       G#m         F#m7    C#m
Lonely sailors    pass the time  a-way
|   F#m    A/E        E
And talk a-bout their homes
|             E    G#m        F#m7   C#m
And there's a girl    in this harbor town
|       F#m    A        D       A
And she works    layin' whiskey down
|         E      G#m       F#m7   C#m
They say, Brandy,   fetch another round
|   F#m         A/E         E
She serves them whiskey and wine

|   C#m         A
    The sailors say: Brandy, you're a fine girl (you're a fine girl)
    What a good wife you would be (such a fine girl)
|              E/B                B               A - E/G# - F#m7 - B7s4
    Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea
     
| E      G#m        F#m7    C#m
  Brandy    wears a braided chain
|       F#m    A               D        A
Made of finest silver from the North of Spain
| E      G#m     F#m7      C#m
A locket    that bears the name
|      F#m      A/E    E
Of the man that Brandy loved
|  E    G#m     F#m7     C#m
He came    on a summer's day
|        F#m    A      D     A
Bringin' gifts    from far a-way
|      E       G#m      F#m7     C#m
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
|  F#m    A/E     E
No harbor was his home

|   C#m         A
    The sailors say: Brandy, you're a fine girl (you're a fine girl)
    What a good wife you would be (such a fine girl)
|          E/B                B           A - E/G# - F#m7 - B7s4
    But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea

|     C#m/C#         C#m/B                  C#m/A           C#m/B
Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes when he told his sailor stories
She could feel the ocean fall and rise, She saw its ragin' glory
|   C#m           D                        C#m           A
But he had always told the truth, Lord, he was an honest man
|   E/B             B            A - E/G# - F#m7 - B7s4
And Brandy does her best to understand

|  E     G#m         F#m7       C#m
At night    when the bars close down
| F#m    A               D      A
  Brandy walks through a silent town
|   E       G#m       F#m7   C#m
And loves a man who's not  a-round
|   F#m       A/E      E
She still can hear him say

|   C#m         A
    She hears him say "Brandy, you're a fine girl (you're a fine girl)
    What a good wife you would be (such a fine girl)
|          E/B                B           A - E/G# - F#m7 - B7s4
    But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea       (slow down, end on E)
