Carlos Santana & Rob Thomas 
Smooth (capo 5 for Cecilia)

INTRO: | Am     F  E  x4
 
|          Am       F   E
Man it's a hot one
|    E7                    Am         F   E
Like seven inches from the midday sun
|            E7             Dm7  Dm7/C     Dm7/B
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
|   E7          Am   F   E
But you stay so cool
| E7   Am   F  E           E7          Am  F E
My munequita,   my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
|       E7         Dm7   Dm7/C  Dm7/B
Your my reason for reason
|    E7         Am     F E
The step in my groove
 
    | E7       Am        F           E    E7
    And if you say this life ain't good enough
    |       Am      F        E       E7
    I would give my world to lift you up
    |       Am        F       E      E7        Dm7  Dm7/C  Dm7/B
    I could change my life to better suit your mood
    | G              Bsus4/F#   Bsus4   E7#9
    Cause you're so smooth
    
    |        Am            F     E         E7
    And it's just like the ocean under the moon
    |               Am           F             E        E7
    Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
    |   Am              F              E     E7
    You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
    | Dm7                     E7
    Gimme your heart, make it real
    |                    Am
    Or else forget about it
 
(LINK) | Am   F  E  x2
 
|             Am        F   E
I'll tell you one thing
| E7                             Am           F    E
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
|        E7               Dm7    Dm7/C       Dm7/B
In every breath and every word,  I hear your name
| E7       Am    F   E
calling me out
| E7         Am     F   E            E7            Am    F   E
Out from the barrio,     you hear my rhythm on the radio
|            E7             Dm7      Dm7/C    Dm7/B
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
| E7        Am      F     E
Turning you round     and round
 
    | E7       Am        F           E    E7
    And if you say this life ain't good enough
    |       Am      F        E       E7
    I would give my world to lift you up
    |       Am        F       E      E7        Dm7  Dm7/C  Dm7/B
    I could change my life to better suit your mood
    | G              Bsus4/F#   Bsus4   E7#9
    Cause you're so smooth
    
    |        Am            F     E         E7
    And it's just like the ocean under the moon
    |               Am           F             E        E7
    Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
    |   Am              F              E     E7
    You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
    | Dm7                     E7
    Gimme your heart, make it real
    |                    Am     (break)
    Or else forget about it ...

                                      Or else forget about it
                                      Or else forget about it
                                  Let's don't forget about it
| Dm7                         E7    N.C.
