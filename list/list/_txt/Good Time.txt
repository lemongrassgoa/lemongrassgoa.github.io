(OC) Woke up on the right side of the bed
     What's up with this Prince song inside my head?
     Hands up, if you're down to get down tonight (Hmm-mm-mm)
    'Cause it's always a good time

(OC) Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care
     Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere
     I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
    'Cause it's always a good time

(CRJ) Good morning and good night
      I'll wake up at twilight
(both)It's gonna be alright
(OC)  We don't even have to try
      It's always a good time (Woo!)

      It's always a good time
(OC)  (Good time, good time, it's always a good time)
(CRJ) (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)

(CRJ) Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again
      Checked out of my room, hit the ATM
      Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight
      'Cause it's always a good time

(OC)   Good morning and good night
(CRJ)  I'll wake up at twilight
(both) It's gonna be alright
(OC)   We don't even have to try
