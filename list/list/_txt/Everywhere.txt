Can you hear me calling / Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
I'll speak a little louder / I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud
And I can't get the words out

    | B - C#m7 - | A - B - | C#m7 - B - | A - B - |
    Oh, I / I want to be with you everywhere
    Oh, I / I want to be with you everywhere
    (Wanna be with you everywhere)

| E - B - | E - B - | E - B - | C#m7 - A - |
Something's happening / Happening to me
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly
Come on, baby / We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

    | B - C#m7 - | A - B - | C#m7 - B - | A - B - |
    Oh, I / I want to be with you everywhere
    Oh, I / I want to be with you everywhere
    (Wanna be with you everywhere)

Can you hear me calling / Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
Come along, baby / We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

    | B - C#m7 - | A - B - | C#m7 - B - | A - B - |
    Oh, I / I want to be with you everywhere
    Oh, I / I want to be with you everywhere
    Oh, I / I want to be with you everywhere
    Oh, I / I want to be with you everywhere
