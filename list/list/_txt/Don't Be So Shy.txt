Don't Be So Shy

Am    Dm7    F  G  Am
Take a breath / Rest your head
Close your eyes / You are right
Just lay down / Turn my side
Do you feel my heat / On your skin

Take off your clothes / Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy / You're right, You're right
Take off my clothes / Oh bless me father
Don't ask me why / You're right, You're right

Home, I stay / I'm in, come in
Can you feel my hips / In your hands
And I'm laying down / On my side
Do you taste the sweat / On my skin

(REFRAIN)

F   E7   Am
And my heart just raced so much faster
I drawn myself in holy water
And both my eyes / Just got so much brighter
And I saw God / Oh yeah so much [E7] closer

Am    Dm7    F  G  Am
In the dark I see your smile
Do you feel my heat / On my skin

Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
