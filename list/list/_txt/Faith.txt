George Michael
Faith  [rhythm: Fusion 3, bpm: 105]

Well I guess it would be nice / If I could touch your body
I know not everybody / Has got a body like you
But I've got to think twice / Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play / Because I play them too

    Oh but I need some time off from that emotion
    Time to pick my heart up off the floor
    And when that love comes down / With-out devotion
    Well it takes a strong man baby / But I'm showing you the door

    'Cause I gotta have faith....

Baby / I know you're asking me to stay
Say please, please, please, don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe / You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

    Before this river becomes an ocean
    Before you throw my heart back on the floor
    Oh baby I reconsider / My foolish notion
    Well I need someone to hold me / But I'll wait for something more

    Yes I gotta have faith....
