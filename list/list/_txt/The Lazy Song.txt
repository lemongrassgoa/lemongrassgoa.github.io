The Lazy Song
Bruno Mars

REFRAIN: Today I don't feel like doing anything 
         I just wanna lay in my bed
         Don't feel like picking up my phone
		 So leave a message at the tone
               G                 B7        C
         Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

         G    D    C
VERSE 1: Oh, I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
         Turn the TV on, Throw my hand in my pants
         Nobody's gonna tell me I can't, nah
         I'll be lying on the couch just chillin' in my snuggie
         Click to MTV so they can teach me how to dougie
               G            B7               C
         Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man
         
                Am             Bm             C                D

(REFRAIN) ......
         Nothing at all
         Ooh hoo, ooh hoo / Hoo ooh ooh, Nothing at all
         Ooh hoo, ooh hoo / Hoo ooh ooh
         
         G    D    C
VERSE 2: Tomorrow I wake up, do some P90X
         Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
         And she's gonna scream out, "This is great" (Oh my god this is great)
         I might mess around and get my college degree
         I bet my old man will be so proud of me
         But sorry pops you just have to wait

BRIDGE:  No I ain't gonna comb my hair
         'cause I ain't going anywhere
         No no no no no no no no nooo
         I'll just strut in my birthday suit
         And let everything hang loose
         Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahhh
