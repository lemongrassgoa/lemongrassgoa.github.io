| A/E        Em7
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurkin' in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze 
                                      CM7/E             Bm7/E
as horror looks you right between the eyes / You're paralyzed

| A/E        Em7
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl
But all the while
                                CM7/E                 Bm7/E
you hear a creature creepin' up behind / You're outta time

    This is the end of your life, ooh

| A/E        Em7

Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
                                     CM7/E                  Bm7/E

[Vincent Price:]
Darkness falls across the land / The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood / To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And whomsoever shall be found / Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell / And rot inside a corpse's shell

The foulest stench is in the air / The funk of forty thousand years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb / Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive / Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist / The evil of the thriller
