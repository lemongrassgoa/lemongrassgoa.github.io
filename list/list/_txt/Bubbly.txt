VERSE 1: I've been awake for a while now
         You've got me feelin' like a child now
         'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
         I get the tingles in a silly place
         
REFRAIN: It starts in my toes / Makes me crinkle my nose
         Wherever it goes / I always know
         That you make me smile / Please stay for a while now
         Just take your time / Wherever you go
         
VERSE 2: The rain is falling on my window pane
         But we are hiding in a safer place
         Under covers staying dry and warm
         You give me feelings that I adore
         
(REFRAIN)

BRIDGE:  But what am I gonna say
         When you make me feel this way
         I just mmmmm

VERSE 3: I've been asleep for a while now
         You tuck me in just like a child now
         'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
         I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth
         
REFRAIN: It starts in my soul / And I lose all control
         When you kiss my nose / The feeling shows
         'Cause you make me smile / Baby, just take your time
         Now holdin' me tight
         
OUTRO:   Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
         Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
         Wherever you go / I always know
         'Cause you make me smile / Even just for a while
