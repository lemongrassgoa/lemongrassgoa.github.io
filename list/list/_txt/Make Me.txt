Make Me
Kina Grannis

Rainbows, I can't find them
Past the raindrops where the light bends
And the stories tell of people
Finding beauty where the dark's hold lets go

    If you want to smile with me
    Hold me close and lie with me
    Oh, if you want to die with me
    Handle my heart carefully
    Make me believe you

I've been searching dreary weather
For a cloud that's lined in silver
But the rain keeps on falling
And my love, I am calling for you

    If you want to smile with me
    Hold me close and lie with me
    Oh, if you want to die with me
    Handle my heart carefully
    Make me believe you

Oh, you can't change the hurt you've done
No, please don't let us come undone
Make me forget
Make me forgive
Make me believe you

    Oh, if you want to smile with me
    Hold me close and lie with me
    Oh, if you want to die with me
    Handle my heart carefully
    Make me believe
