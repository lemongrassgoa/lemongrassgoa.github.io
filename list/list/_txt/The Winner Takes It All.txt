I don't wanna talk / About things we've gone through

Though it's hurting me / Now it's history
                   G                              D
I've played all my cards / And that's what you've done too
                Am                   D
Nothing more to say / No more ace to play

    Beside the victory / That's her destiny

I was in your arms / Thinking I belonged there
                  Am                    D
I figured it made sense / Building me a fence
              G                      D
Building me a home / Thinking I'd be strong there
            Am                    D
But I was a fool / Playing by the rules

                         G            B7        Em
    The gods may throw a dice / Their minds as cold as ice
        E7          Am                        D
    And someone way down here / Loses someone dear
                        G         B7           Em
    The winner takes it all / The loser has to fall
          E7             Am                      D
    It's simple and it's plain / Why should I complain?

                      G                     D
But tell me, does she kiss / Like I used to kiss you?
                 Am                         D
Does it feel the same / When she calls your name?
                 G                      D
Somewhere deep inside / You must know I miss you
               Am                    D
But what can I say? / Rules must be obeyed

                      G          B7           Em
    The judges will decide / The likes of me abide

    A big thing or a small / The winner takes it all

              G                      D
I don't wanna talk / If it makes you feel sad
           Am                              D
And I understand / You've come to shake my hand
       G                      D
I apologize / If it makes you feel bad
             Am                   D
Seeing me so tense / No self-confidence / But you see

The winner takes it all
Am       | D
The winner takes it all

(So the winner, takes it all)
