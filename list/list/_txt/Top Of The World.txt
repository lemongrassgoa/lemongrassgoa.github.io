INTRO: G     G7(+) C    C#-7  
       G/D - Em7 - Am - D7   G   C ...

G               D      C    G
Such a feelin's comin' over me
         Bm             Am    D7      G(7)
There is wonder in most every thing I see
      C            D            Bm7       E7
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
      Am7         Am7b5            D7       (D+)
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

G            D        C        G
Everything I want the world to be
       Bm            Am    D7     G   G7
Is now comin' true especially for me
        C         D             Bm7           Bdim7
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here
           Am7              Am7b5            D-D6-D7
You're the nearest thing to Heaven that I've seen

               G                          C
    I'm on the / top of the world lookin' / down on creation
            G         Am     D7    G     Dm7-G7
    And the only explanation I can find
           C              D          G                 C
    Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
                G      Em     Am  D7     G
    Your love's put me at the top of the world

G                D        C          G
Somethin' in the wind has learned my name
         Bm              Am         D7      G(7)
And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
       C             D             Bm7          E7
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
          Am7               Am7b5         D7      (D+)
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me

G             D        C     G
There is only one wish on my mind
          Bm               Am        D7     G   G7
When this day is through I hope that I will find
       C           D           Bm7              Bdim7
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
      Am7          Am7b5           D-D6-D7
All I need will be mine if you are here
