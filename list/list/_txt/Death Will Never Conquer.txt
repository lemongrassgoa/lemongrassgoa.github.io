Death Will Never Conquer
Coldplay (orig Eb)

D                          G       D
If sweet death should ever conquer me
       D                  A
Let me know, boys, let me know
   D                              G      D
If you hear him coming, won't you let me flee
       D         A      D
Let me go, boys, let me go

D                      G       D
One day death is gonna conquer me
        D                     A
I'll be down where the waters flow
  D                        G         D
I hope sweet heaven is the place for me
       D           A      D
Let me know, boys, let me know

(INTERLUDE)

D                          G       D
If sweet death should ever conquer me
        D                  A
Take me down to some place below
   D                              G      D
If you hear him coming, won't you set me free
       D        A      D
Let me go boys, let me go

Bm              A                 G       D
If you hear him comin', won't you say for me
       D          A       D
That I just don't want to go
