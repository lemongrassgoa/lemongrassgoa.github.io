Those Were The Days (orig. F#m)

Em      Am      B7      Em
 
Em
Once upon a time, there was a tavern
E7                                Am
Where we used to raise a glass or two
                                 Em
Remember how we laughed away the hours,
F#7*                                   B7
Think of all the great things we would do
 
                   Em
    Those were the days, my friend
                      Am
    We thought they'd never end
                  D        D7         G
    We'd sing and dance forever and a day
                  Am
    We'd live the life we'd choose
                   Em
    We'd fight and never lose
                B7                         Em
    For we were young and sure to have our way
 
Em              E
La La La  La La La La La
Am
La La La La La La
      B7                   Em
La La La La La La La La La La
 
Em
Then, the busy years went rushing by us
E7                                Am
We lost our starry notions on the way
                                  Em
If, by chance, I'd see you in the tavern,
     F#7*                          B7
We'd smile at one another and we'd say
 
                   Em
    Those were the days, my friend
                      Am
    We thought they'd never end
                  D        D7         G
    We'd sing and dance forever and a day
                  Am
    We'd live the life we'd choose
                   Em
    We'd fight and never lose
                   B7                           Em
    Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days
 
Em              E
La La La  La La La La La
Am
La La La La La La
      B7                   Em
La La La La La La La La La La
 
Em
Just tonight, I stood before the tavern
E7                                Am
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
                                Em
In the glass, I saw a strange reflection
F#7*                         B7
Was that lonely woman really me?
 
                   Em
    Those were the days, my friend
                      Am
    We thought they'd never end
                  D        D7         G
    We'd sing and dance forever and a day
                  Am
    We'd live the life we'd choose
                   Em
    We'd fight and never lose
                   B7                           Em
    Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days
 
(repeat chorus chords)
La la la ... 

Em
Through the door, there came familiar laughter
E7                                    Am
I saw your face and heard you call my name
                                  Em
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser
F#7*                                        B7
For in our hearts, the dreams are still the same
 
                   Em
    Those were the days, my friend
                      Am
    We thought they'd never end
                  D        D7         G
    We'd sing and dance forever and a day
                  Am
    We'd live the life we'd choose
                   Em
    We'd fight and never lose
                   B7                           Em
    Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days

Em              E

La La La La La La

Those Were The Days

Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
Think of all the great things we would do?

    Those were the days, my friend
    We thought they'd never end
    We'd sing and dance forever and a day
    We'd live the life we choose
    We'd fight and never lose
    For we were young and sure to have our way
    La-la-la-da-da-da / La-la-la-da-da-da
    Da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

    Those were the days, my friend
    We thought they'd never end
    We'd sing and dance forever and a day
    We'd live the life we choose
    We'd fight and never lose
    Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days
    La-la-la-da-da-da / La-la-la-da-da-da
    Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me?

    Those were the days, my friend
    We thought they'd never end
    We'd sing and dance forever and a day
    We'd live the life we choose
    We'd fight and never lose
    Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days
    La-la-la-da-da-da / La-la-la-da-da-da
    Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
    La-la-la-da-da-da / La-la-la-da-da-da
    Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

Through the door, there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts, the dreams are still the same

    Those were the days, my friend
    We thought they'd never end
    We'd sing and dance forever and a day
    We'd live the life we choose
    We'd fight and never lose
    Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days
    La-la-la-da-da-da / La-la-la-da-da-da
    Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
    La-la-la-da-da-da / La-la-la-da-da-da
    Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
    La-la-la-la-la-la-la
    La-la-la-la-la-la-la
    La-la-la-la-la-la-la
