    Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
    Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
    Only know you love her when you let her go
    Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
    Only hate the road when you're missin' home
    Only know you love her when you let her go
      And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much
And you dived too deep

    Only hate the road when you're missin' home
    Only know you love her when you let her go
