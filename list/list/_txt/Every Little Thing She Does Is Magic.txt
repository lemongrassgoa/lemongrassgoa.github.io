The Police
Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic [rhythm: Simple 4, bpm: 150]
(sing in F)

| F - C - F

| Bbs2
Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

|   Bb    C    F
    Every little thing she does is magic
    Everything she does just turns me on
    Even though my life before was tragic
    Now I know my love for her goes on 
                                  | Db   Eb   F
    
| Bbs2
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

|   Bb    C    F
    Every little thing she does is magic
    Every little thing just turns me on
    Even though my life before was tragic
    Now I know my love for her goes on 

|        Db       Eb
BRIDGE:  I resolve to call her up
         a thousand times a day
         And ask her if she'll marry me
         in some old fashioned way
         But my silent fears have gripped me
         Long before I reach the phone
         Long before my tongue has tripped me
         Must I always be alone?

    Now I know my love for her goes on
