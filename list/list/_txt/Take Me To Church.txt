Take Me To Church
(Simi capo 4)

Em    Am7  Em   Am7  /  G    Am7  Em   Am7
My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
[Ds4/A] "We were born sick," / [CM7] you heard them say it

Em    Am7  Em   Am7  /  G    Am7  Em   Am7 
My church offers no absolution
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom."
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
[Ds4/A] I was born sick / [CM7] But I love her
CM7                     G    C G   Cm G  Cm  G
Command me to be well / Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen.

    /A /G, /G /F#
    Em     B7     G   Am7   Em
    Take me to church
    I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
    I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
    Offer me that deathless death / Good God, let me give you my life

Em    Am7  Em   Am7  /  G    Am7  Em   Am7
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Ds4/A                   CM7
Drain the whole sea / Get something shiny
Em    Am7  Em   Am7  /  G    Am7  Em   Am7 
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
Ds4/A                   CM7
That looks tasty / That looks plenty / This is hungry work

    /A /G, /G /F#
    Em     B7     G   Am7   Em
    Take me to church
    I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
    I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
    Offer me that deathless death / Good God, let me give you my life

C    G    B7     Em
No Masters or Kings / When the Ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and stil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human / Only then I am clean   [Em/D    C]
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen.
