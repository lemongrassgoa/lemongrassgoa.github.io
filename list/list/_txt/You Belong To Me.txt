You Belong To Me
Bryan Adams (orig A)

G   ...     Em      D       G
I take the night train / I take an airplane
Cause you belong to me
I just wanna say / Ain't gonna let you get away
Cause you belong to me

Em      D       G       C
I only wanna hold you
I just wanna hold you
Come on, let me hold you tonight

G   ...     Em      D       G
You say you ain't leaving / Can't help dreaming
You belong to me
I'll take that highway / I take the low way
No, you belong to me

Em      D       G       C
I only wanna hold you
I just wanna hold you
Come on, let me hold you tonight

(strum chords)
Em      D       G       C

G   ...     Em      D       G
I'm not drinking / It gets me thinking
You belong to me
While you're out there / Remember, I'm right here
And you belong to me

Em      D       G       C
I only wanna hold you
I just wanna hold you
Come on, let me hold you
Come on, let me hold you ...
C
... Tonight
