Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight) [drum: 909 clap, bpm: 120]

| Dm - - - | Dm-C-F - - | Am - - - | Dm - - -

Half past twelve
And I'm [G7] watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my [Dm] own
Autumn winds
Blowing [G7] outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the [Dm] gloom

[BbM7] There's not a soul out there
[Gm7]  No one to hear my prayer  [A7s4]

    | Dm    Bb    C    Dm
    Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
    | Bb    Dm    C    Dm
    Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
    | Dm    Bb    C    Dm
    Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
    | Bb    Dm    C    Dm
    Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

| Dm - - - | Dm-C-F - - | Am - - - | Dm - - -

Movie stars
Find the [G7] end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living [Dm] in
Tired of T.V.
I [G7] open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in [Dm] sight

[BbM7] There's not a soul out there
[Gm7]  No one to hear my prayer  [A7s4]

    | Dm    Bb    C    Dm
    Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
    | Bb    Dm    C    Dm
    Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
    | Dm    Bb    C    Dm
    Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
    | Bb    Dm    C    Dm
    Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

    Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight...
    Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight...
