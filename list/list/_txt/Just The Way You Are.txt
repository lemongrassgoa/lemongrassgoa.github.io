Just The Way You Are
Bruno Mars (orig. F)

Oh, her eyes, her eyes / Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair / Falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know / When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so / Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?" / I say

    When I see your face / There's not a thing that I would change
    'Cause you're amazing / Just the way you are
    And when you smile / The whole world stops and stares for a while
    'Cause girl, you're amazing / Just the way you are / Yeah

Her lips, her lips / I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh / She hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searchin' for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay / You know I'll say

    When I see your face / There's not a thing that I would change
    'Cause you're amazing / Just the way you are
    And when you smile / The whole world stops and stares for a while
    'Cause girl, you're amazing / Just the way you are / Yeah

The way you are / The way you are
Girl, you're amazing  Just the way you are

    When I see your face / There's not a thing that I would change
    'Cause you're amazing / Just the way you are
    And when you smile / The whole world stops and stares for a while
    'Cause girl, you're amazing / Just the way you are / Yeah
