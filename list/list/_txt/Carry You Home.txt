VERSE 1: Trouble is her only friend and he's back again
         Makes her body older than it really is
         She says it's high time she went away
         No one's got much to say in this town
         Trouble is the only way is down / down, down
         
|        G    Em    Bm    C
REFRAIN: As strong as you were, tender you go
         I'm watching you breathing for the last time
         A song for your heart, but when it is quiet
         I know what it means and I'll carry you home
         I'll carry you home
         
|        [G           Em   C]   ...  G    D
VERSE 2: If she had wings she would fly away
         And another day God will give her some
         Trouble is the only way is down / down, down

BRIDGE:  And they were all born pretty in New York City tonight
         And someone's little girl was taken from the world tonight
         Under the [Am] Stars [G] and [D] Stripes
