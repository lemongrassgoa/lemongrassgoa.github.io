| F    Dm    Am    G    F    Dm

[Am] I didn't want to be the one to forget
[G]  I thought of everything I'd never regret
[F]  A little time with you is all that I get
[Dm] That's all we need because it's all we can take

[Am] One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
[G]  I don't believe in him, his lips on the ground
[F]  I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche" ("rush")
[Dm] But no one gives us any time anymore

[Am] He asks me once if I'd look in on his dog
[G]  You made an offer for it, then you ran off
[F]  I got this picture of us kids in my head
[Dm] And all I hear is the last thing that you said

[Am] "I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"
[G]  I didn't want to anymore, oh, oh, oh

    |           Am        G     F
    And we will never be alone again
    |         F              Em    Dm   
    'Cause it doesn't happen every day
    |     Dm             F       G
    Kinda counted on you being a friend
    |     Em
    Can I give it up or give it away?
    |     Am                 G       F
    Now I thought about what I wanna say
    |     F            Em            Dm   
    But I never really know where to go
    |    Dm        F         G
    So I chained myself to a friend
    |        Em
    'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
    
    |           Am        G     F
    And we will never be alone again

    So I chained myself to a friend
| Em     F              Dm
    Some more again

    
[Am] It didn't matter what they wanted to see
[G]  He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
[F]  The summer memory that just never dies
[Dm] We worked too long and hard to give it no time

[Am] He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
[G]  Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
[F]  He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall
[Dm] He cannot break it down or else he would fall

[Am] One thousand lonely stars
[G]  Hiding in the cold
[F]  Take it, I don't wanna [Dm] sing anymore
