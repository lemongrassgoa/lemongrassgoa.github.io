Something Coming Over
OAR (orig. A)

Who's that with his arm around you?
He making eyes at you that way
He looks in love
Oh, man, he looks familiar
Damn it's me
Never thought I'd see that day
It's like I came to from sleeping
No more bed rails
I'm pulled to daylight by your voice
Not that I had any choice
Now there's something coming over me
I know it's you
And there's someone that I used to be
But he is through
And I know that it's forever
And it's hard to do
There's something coming over me
I know it's you
And now we're talking 'bout the future
And a future wide open
But you love, love, love will be the best place
I've ever been
And it was you to the rescue
Did I mention that I've never felt like this before?
I'm powerless to fight it anymore
Now there's something coming over me
I know it's you
And there's someone that I used to be
But he is through
And I know that it's forever
And it's overdue
There's something coming over me
I know it's you
Used to watch this game from the sidelines
Now it's time to get on in and play
You've been waiting there for me for my whole life
Now it's all you
Now it's all you
And I know that it's forever
And it's overdue
There's something coming over me
I know it's you
Now there's something coming over me
I know it's you
And there's someone that I used to be
But he is through
And I know that it's forever
And it's overdue
There's something coming over me
I know it's you
I know, I know it's you, baby
