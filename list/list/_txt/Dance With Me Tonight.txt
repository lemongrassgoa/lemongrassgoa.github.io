Olly Murs
Dance With Me Tonight

My name is Olly nice to meet you can I tell you baby
Look around there's a whole lot of pretty ladies
But none like you, you shine so bright, yeah

I was wondering if you and me could spend a minute
On the floor up and close getting lost in it
I won't give up without a fight

I just wanna, oo-ooh, ooh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight
So come on, oo-ooh, ooh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight

We're getting sweaty, hot and heavy in the crowd now
Loosen up and let your hands go down, down
But go with it girl, yeah just close your eyes, yeah

I feel the music moving through your body
And looking at you I can tell you want me
Don't stop, keep going till the morning light, yeah

When I saw you there, sitting all alone in the dark
acting like you didn't have a care
I knew right then, that you'd be mine, 
and we'd be dancing the whole damn night like

Oo-ooh, ooh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight
So come on, oo-ooh, oooh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight

[yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah ...]

I just wanna, oo-ooh, ooh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight
Everybody everybody come on now
Oo-ooh   (Girl just close your eyes)
Ooh baby (We can dance all through the night)
I just want you to dance with me tonight

And everybody sing
Oo-ooh (Girl just close your eyes)
Ooh baby (We can dance all through the night)
I just want you to dance with me tonight
So come on girl just close your eyes
We can dance all through the night
I just want you to dance with me tonight
