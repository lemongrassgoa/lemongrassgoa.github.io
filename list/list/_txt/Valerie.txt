Amy Winehouse ft Mark Ronson (The Zutons)
Valerie

| CM7           Dm7
Well sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing and in my head I paint a picture
 
    | FM7           Em7
    'Cos since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
    And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
    Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of [G] me
    Why don't you come on over (Valerie)  x4
                               [CM7      Dm7]

Did you have to go to jail, put your house on up for sale, did you get a good lawyer
I hope you didn't catch a tan, I hope you found the right man who'll fix it for ya
Are you shoppin' anywhere, changed the colour of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine you was dodging all the time are you still dizzy

    Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of [G] me
    Why don't you come on over (Valerie)  x4
