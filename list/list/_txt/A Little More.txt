A Little More sing in F

         F   Bb   Dm   C
VERSE 1: Right about the time I missed your call
         I lost my mind the drugs wore off
         It's raining where I am, I hope you see
         the text I sent and don't go soft
         
LINK:   [Bb] 'Cause I can't stand to be alone
        [C]  When the buzz starts wearing off
         
         F   Bb   Dm   C
REFRAIN: Can I get a little more
         Can I get a little more
         From you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
         From you-oo-oo-oo-oh-whoa
         Can I get a little more
         Can I get a little more from you
         
         F   Bb   Dm   C
VERSE 2: That's me sitting in the bathroom with the lights off
         Nobody knows the kind of stuff I gotta to fight off
         I wash away my sins but I can't get the white off
         What made you think that you could ever take the night off
                                          (strum off)

BRIDGE:  And I don't know who else to call     \
         You're leaving me between the walls   |
         You fake me out, you say you care     |   x2
         You break me down, I go nowhere       /
         
(strum off)
         Can I get a little more / Can I get a little more
         From you (crescendo)

         F   Bb   Dm   C
      /  Can I get a little bit, a little bit
   x2 |  I said can I get a little little little bit more from you
      \  Whoa ...
