  When you came to me / With your bad dreams and your fears
| C              D7s4           G        D
  It was easy to see you'd been crying
| G          Bm                  Em               C
  Seems like everywhere you turn / Catastrophe it reigns
| C            D7s4             G        D
But who really profits from the dying?

    | Em      G              C      F  C
      I could hold you in my arms
    | D7s4                G      D
      I could hold you forever
    | G           Bm             Em     F  C
      And I could hold you in my arms
    | D                      G     D
      Oh I could hold you forever

| G        Bm            Em                          C
  When you kissed my lips / With my mouth so full of questions
| C          D7s4          G         D
  My worried mind that you quiet
| G          Bm              Em          C
  Place your hands on my face / Close my eyes and say
| C              D7s4            G                    D
  That love is a poor man's food / Don't prophesize

    | Em      G              C      F  C
      I could hold you in my arms
    | D7s4                G      D
      I could hold you forever
    | G           Bm             Em     F  C
      And I could hold you in my arms
    | D7s4                   G     D
      Oh I could hold you forever

| G         Bm            Em            C
  So now we see how it is / This fist begets the spear
| C          D                 G         D
  Weapons of war / Symptoms of madness
| G             Bm
  Don't let your eyes refuse to see
| Em             C
  Don't let your ears refuse to hear
| C            D                           G               D
  Or you ain't never going to shake / This sense of sadness
  
    | Em      G              C      F  C
      I could hold you in my arms
    | D7s4                G      D
      I could hold on forever
    | G           Bm             Em     F  C

      Oh I could hold on forever
