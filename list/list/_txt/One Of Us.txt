If God had a name what would it be
And would you call it to His face
If you were faced with Him in all His glory
What would you ask if you had just one question?

  And yeah, yeah God is great
  Yeah, yeah God is good
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

    What if God was one of us
    Just a slob like one of us
    Just a stranger on the bus
    Trying to make His way home

If God had a face what would it look like
And would you want to see
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like Heaven and in Jesus and the Saints
And all the Prophets

  And yeah, yeah God is great
  Yeah, yeah God is good
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

    What if God was one of us
    Just a slob like one of us
    Just a stranger on the bus
    Trying to make his way home
    Tryin' to make his way home
    Back up to Heaven all alone
    Nobody callin' on the phone
    Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome

    Like a holy rolling stone
    Back up to Heaven all alone
    Just tryin' to make his way home
