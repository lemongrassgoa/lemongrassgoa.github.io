Spit On A Stranger

D           D/C#    D/B         G  A
However you feel,   whatever it takes
Whenever it's real, whatever awaits
Whatever you need,  however so slight
Whenever it's real, whenever it's right
Bm                        Bm/Bb                     Bm/A       Bm/G#
I'll be thinking long and hard about the things you said to me
G             D(/A)    (D/Bb)
Like a bitter stranger
Bm                     Bm/Bb                        Bm/A       Bm/G#
Now I see the long and short, the middle and what's in between

    G                  D         E7      G
     I could spit on a stranger (pull me out)
     You're a  bitter  stranger (pull me out)

D           D/C#    D/B         G  A
Whatever you feel,  whatever it takes
Whenever it's real, whatever awaits me
Whatever you need,  however so slight
Wherever it leads,  whenever it's right
Bm                     Bm/Bb                       Bm/A         Bm/G#
Honey, I'm a prize and you're a catch, and we're a perfect match
G               D(/A)    (D/Bb)
Like two bitter strangers
Bm                         Bm/Bb                    Bm/A         Bm/G#
And now I see the long and short of it, and I could make it last

    G                  D         E7      G
     I could spit on a stranger (pull me out)     \
     You're a  bitter  stranger (pull me out)     |
     I could spit on a stranger (pull me out)     |     x2
     You're a  bitter  stranger (pull me out)     /

(single strum)
G                                D      E7     G
I  see  the  sunshine  in  your  eyes
I'll try the things you'll never try
I'll be the one that leaves you  high
