Venus (orig Em) (capo 2) [rhythm: Simple 2, bpm: 130]

INTRO:  E7s4

[ Am    D7 ]
A goddess on a mountain top / Was burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love / And Venus was her name

        [ Dm     G  ]     ....    [ Am    D7 ]
    She's got it / Yeah baby, she's got it
          F                E7s4             [ Am      D7 ]
    Well, I'm your Venus / I'm your fire / At your desire
    Well, I'm your Venus / I'm your fire / At your desire

[ Am    D7 ]
Her weapons were her crystal eyes / Making every man mad
Black as the dark night she was / Got what no one else had

        [ Dm     G  ]     ....    [ Am    D7 ]
    She's got it / Yeah baby, she's got it
          F                E7s4             [ Am      D7 ]
    Well, I'm your Venus / I'm your fire / At your desire
    Well, I'm your Venus / I'm your fire / At your desire
