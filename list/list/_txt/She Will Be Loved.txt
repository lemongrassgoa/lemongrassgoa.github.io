(INTRO)
Bm    A   |  x2

(VERSE 1)
Bm              A               Bm                   A
Beauty queen of only eighteen / She had some trouble with herself
Bm            A                   Bm                     A
He was always there to help her / She always belonged to someone else
Bm          A                     Bm               A
I drove for miles and miles / And wound up at your door
Bm           A                    Bm             A
I've had you so many times but  / somehow I want more

(REFRAIN)
D5                    A          Bm                        G5
I don't mind spending everyday / Out on your corner in the pouring rain
D5                         A              Bm                      G5
Look for the girl with the broken smile / Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
        D5      A           Bm      G
And she will be loved / She will be loved

(VERSE 2)
Tap on my window knock on my door / I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure / It doesn't matter any more
It's not always rainbows and butterflies / It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open / You can come any time you want

(REFRAIN)

(BRIDGE)
Bm               A7     Bm                
I know where you hide / Alone in your car
                A
Know all of the things that make you who you are
Bm              A7                     Bm
I know that goodbye / means nothing at all
                          A                        G
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls, yeah ...
Bm               A                  Bm                      A
Tap on my window knock on my door / I want to make you feel beautiful
