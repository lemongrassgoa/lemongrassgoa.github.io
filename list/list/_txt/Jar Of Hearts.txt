Jar of Hearts
Christina Perri (capo 1)

| Bm    D    A    Em
I know I can't take one more step towards you
'Cause all that's waiting is regret
| Bm    D    A    G         G  D
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most
| Em    G    Bm   A               Em    G    As4-A
I learned to live half a life / And now you want me one more time

    | D    A    Bm    G - Gm
    And who do you think you are?
    Running 'round leaving scars
    Collecting a jar of hearts
    Tearing love apart
    You're gonna catch a cold
    From the ice inside your soul
    So don't come back for me
    Who do you think you are?

| Bm    D    A    Em
I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
| Bm    D    A    G         G  D
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms
| Em    G    Bm   A               Em    G    As4-A
I've learned to live half a life / And now you want me one more time

    | D    A    Bm    G - Gm
    And who do you think you are?
    Running 'round leaving scars
    Collecting a jar of hearts
    Tearing love apart
    You're gonna catch a cold
    From the ice inside your soul
    So don't come back for me
    Who do you think you are?

(BRIDGE)
| Bm    Bb+    D/A    E/G#
It took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises
[G] And now you're back / You don't get to [F#7] get me back

    | D    A    Bm    G - Gm          \
    And who do you think you are?      \
    Running 'round leaving scars        |
    Collecting a jar of hearts          |
    Tearing love apart                  |  x2
    You're gonna catch a cold           |
    From the ice inside your soul       |
    So don't come back for me          /
    Who do you think you are?         /

| G          Gm6        D        |
  Who do you think you are?      |   x3
