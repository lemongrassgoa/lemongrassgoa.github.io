Why don't we take a little piece of summer sky / hang it on a tree.
|              C#m7(b5)        CM7           Am7         D7s         G
For that's the way to start to make a pretty world / for you and for me.
|           C#m7(b5)         CM7             D7/C                    Bm7   Am7   GM7
And for the sun we'll find a lemon bright balloon / you can hold the string.
|             C#m7(b5)        CM7                Am7      D7s       G       C#m7(b5)
Oh, can't you see that little world of ours will be / the prettiest thing.

  | CM7                 D7/C                      Bm7            E7
    We can gather rain enough for the stream / To hold our happy faces.

    When you want a breeze / I'll blow you a kiss or two.
  | CM7                      D7/C                    Bm7             E7
    Take me in your arms and our little world / will be the place of places.

    Nothing must be made but breakfast and love ... (intro)

We'll hang a little sign that just says, "Paradise / Population two."
|        C#m7(b5)      CM7           Am7         D7s         G
I know together we can make a pretty world / For me and for you
|   Em7        Am7      D7s        B7      E7      Am7    D7s        G     C#m7(b5)
For you / It's what I'm longing to do / To do / to make a world with you.
