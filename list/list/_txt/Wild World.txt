Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breakin' my heart you're leavin'
Baby, I'm grievin'
But if you wanna leave, take good care
I hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out [G]there

  | C   G           F
    Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
  | G                F              C
    It's hard to get by just upon a smile
  | C   G           F
    Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
  | G             F                 C
    I'll always remember you like a child, girl  |  Dm  E

| Am   D7   GM7   CM7   FM7   Dm7  E(7)
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breakin' my heart in two
Because I never wanna see you a sad girl
Don't be a bad girl
But if you wanna leave, take good care
I hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

  | C   G           F
    Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
  | G                F              C
    It's hard to get by just upon a smile
  | C   G           F
    Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
  | G             F                 C
    I'll always remember you like a child, girl  |  Dm  E
