Everything At Once

(INTRO) | Dm
 
(VERSE 1)
[Dm] As sly as a fox as strong as an ox
     As fast as a hare as brave as a bear
[C]  As free as a bird as neat as a word
     As quiet as a mouse as big as a house
 
    | Dm    C
    All I wanna be, 
    All I wanna be, oh oh oh
    All I wanna be is [A] everything
 
(VERSE 2)
[Dm] As mean as a wolf as sharp as a tooth
     As deep as a bite as dark as the night
[C]  As sweet as a song as right as a wrong
     As long as a road as ugly as a toad
     
[Dm] As pretty as a picture hanging from a fixture 
     Strong like a family, strong as I wanna be
[C]  Bright as day as light as play
     As hard as nails as grand as a whale
 
    | Dm    C
    All I wanna be, oh oh oh
    All I wanna be, oh oh oh
    All I wanna be is [A] everything
 
Everything at [Bb] once
Everything at [Dm] once, ohh ohh [Bb] ohh
Everything at [A]  once
 
(VERSE 3)
[Dm] As warm as the sun as silly as fun
     As cool as a tree as scary as the sea
[C]  As hot as fire as cold as ice 
     Sweet as sugar and everything nice
     
[Dm] As old as time as straight as a line
     As royal as a queen as buzzed as a bee
[C]  Stealth as a tiger, smooth as a glide 
     Pure as a melody, [N.C.] pure as I wanna be
 
(CHORUS)
    | Dm    C
    All I wanna be, oh oh oh
    All I wanna be, oh oh oh
    All I wanna be is [A] everything
    Everything at [Dm] once
