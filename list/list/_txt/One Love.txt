One Love
Blue

         | Am7   Bm7   Em7
VERSE 1: It's kinda funny / how life can change
         Can flip 180 / in a matter of days
         Sometimes love works in / mysterious ways
         |           Am7                      D7s4
         One day you wake up / gone without a trace
         
         | Am   D   Em   Bm
BRIDGE:  I refuse to give up / I refuse to give in
         You're my everything
         I don't wanna give up / I don't wanna give in, oh no
         | Am7        D7s4
           Everybody sing 
         
         [C   D   Em   Bm]
REFRAIN: One love - for the mother's pride
         One love - for the times we cried
         One love - gotta stay alive
         I will survive
         One love - for the city streets
         One love - for the hip-hop beats
     [C] One love, Oh I do believe
   [Ds4] One love is all we need
         
         | Am7   Bm7   Em7
VERSE 2: Late at night I'm / still wide awake
         Feel this is far more / than I can take
         I thought my heart could / never break
         |     Am7                      D7s4
         Now I know that's / one big mistake
