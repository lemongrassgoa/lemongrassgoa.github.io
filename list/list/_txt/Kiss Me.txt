Kiss Me [rhythm: Groove 1 / Simple 4, bpm: 105]

INTRO:   D   DM7   D7   DM7    |  x2

Kiss me / out of the bearded barley
Nightly / beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing / swing the spinning step
You wear those shoes and I [G] will wear that dress, oh ...

    Em   A  D           Bm(7)
    Kiss me beneath the milky twilight
    Em   A  D          D7
    Lead me out on the moonlit floor
    Em        A
    Lift your open hand
    D             F#m/C#            Bm(7) 
    Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
    A           G(s2)      Asus4  A  
    silver moon sparkling
             D   DM7   D7   DM7
    ... So kiss me

Kiss me / down by the broken tree house
Swing me / upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring / bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on [G] your father's map, oh ...

    Em   A  D           Bm(7)
    Kiss me beneath the milky twilight
    Em   A  D          D7
    Lead me out on the moonlit floor
    Em        A
    Lift your open hand
    D             F#m/C#            Bm(7) 
    Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
    A           G(s2)      Asus4  A  
    silver moon sparkling
             D   DM7   D7   DM7
