Sting
Until

Em  ...  F#

   Bm  /A         GM7
If I   caught the world in a bottle
    Em7   F#7       Bm       /A            GM7
And every-thing was still be-neath the moon
     Em7                    F#7    C#m7b5    F#7
With-out your love would it shine for me?
   Bm    /A       GM7
If I was smart as Aristotle
    Em7   F#7       Bm      /A            GM7
And under-stood the rings a-round the moon
     Em7                    F#7    C#m7b5    F#7
What would it all matter if you loved me?
 
                 Em7     /D
    Here in your arms
              A/C#        A7       D     /C#
    where the world is im-possibly still
           Bm      /A            G#m7b5
    With a million dreams to ful-fill
          G7                   F#7     C#m7b5     F#7  
    And a matter of moments un-til the dancing ends
                 Em7     /D
    Here in your arms
         A/C#       A7          D     /C#
    when everything seems to be clear
          Bm       /A            G#m7b5
    Not a solitary thing would I fear
       G7                          F#7      C#m7b5     F#7  
    Ex-cept when this moment comes near the dancing's end

   Bm  /A         GM7          /A  /B
If I   caught the world in an hourglass
C#m7b5   F#7    Bm      /A          GM7
Saddled  up the moon so we could ride
   Em7     Bm         G#m7b5    G
Un-til the stars grew dim,    Until...


Cm   /Bb  G#M7    
One  day  you'll meet a stranger 
    Fm7     G7       Cm       /Bb         G#M7
And all the noise is silenced in the room
       Fm7                            G7   Dm7b5   G7
You'll feel that you're close to some mystery
       Cm   /Bb       G#M7    
In the moon-light and everything shatters
    Fm7     G7        Cm        /Bb         G#M7
You feel as if you've known her all your life
    Fm7                      G7    Dm7b5   G7
The world's oldest lesson in history

                 Fm7   /D# 
    Here in your arms
              Bb/D        Bb7      Eb    /D
    where the world is im-possibly still
           Cm      /Bb           Am7b5
    With a million dreams to ful-fill
          G#7                  G7      Dm7b5     G7
    And a matter of moments un-til the dancing ends
                 Fm7   /D# 
    Here in your arms
         Bb/D       Bb7         Eb    /D
    when everything seems to be clear
          Cm       /Bb        Am7b5
    Not a solitary thing do I fear
       G#7                         G7       Dm7b5     G7
    Ex-cept when this moment comes near the dancing's end

       Cm  /Bb        G#M7    
Oh, if I   caught the world in an hourglass
Fm7     G7     Cm       /Bb          G#M7
Saddled up the moon and we would ride
   Fm7     Cm         Am7b5
Un-til the stars grew dim 
   G#M7    Fm7       Cm          Am7b5
Un-til the time that time stands still
   G#M7    Fm7    Cm    Am7b5    G#M7    Fm7    Cm (end)
Un-til...
