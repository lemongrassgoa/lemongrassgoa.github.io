    C                                                         G
    Super trouper beams are gonna blind me / But I won't feel blue
    Dm            G                                          C
    Like I always do / 'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

(RIFF)
C       Am      Dm      G

C                            Em             Dm                         G
I was sick and tired of everything / When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing / Wishing every show was the last show
F                C                     
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
Suddenly I feel all right (And suddenly it's gonna be)
F                    C                                  G
And it's gonna be so different when I'm on the stage to-night

    C                                                                     G
    Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me / Shining like the sun
    Dm              G                           C
    Smiling, having fun / Feeling like a number one
    C                                                                     G
    Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me / But I won't feel blue
    Dm            G                                          C
    Like I always do / 'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

C                              Em                Dm           G
Facing twenty thousand of your friends / How can anyone be so lonely
Part of a success that never ends / Still I'm thinking about you only
F                C                     
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
But it's gonna be alright (You'll soon be changing everything)
F                     C                                    G
Everything will be so different / When I'm on the stage to-night

    C                                                                     G
    Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me / Shining like the sun
    Dm              G                           C
    Smiling, having fun / Feeling like a number one

    Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me / But I won't feel blue
    Dm            G                                          C
    Like I always do / 'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

           F              Am
So I'll be there when you arrive
             Dm                G            C
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
             C       G       F                  Dm       A7/E
And when you take me in your arms / And hold me tight
  Dm/F                            G
I know it's gonna mean so much to-night
