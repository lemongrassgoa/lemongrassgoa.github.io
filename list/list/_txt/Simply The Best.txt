Simply The Best (orig capo 4 G)

I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire
You come to me, wild and wired
You come to me, give me everything I need

Give me a life time of promises and a world of dreams
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
And it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong, babe

    You're simply the best / Better than all the rest
    Better than anyone / Anyone I ever met
    And I'm stuck on your heart / I hang on every word you say
    Tear us apart / Baby I would rather be dead

In your heart I see the start of every night and every day
In your eyes I get lost, I get washed away
Just as long I'm here in your arms I could be in no better place

    You're simply the best / Better than all the rest
    Better than anyone / Anyone I ever met
    And I'm stuck on your heart / I hang on every word you say
    Tear us apart / Baby I would rather be dead

Each time you leave me I start losing control
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
I can feel you even when I'm alone / Oh, baby, don't let go

    'Cause you're simply the best / Better than all the rest
    Better than anyone / Anyone I ever met
    And I'm stuck on your heart / I hang on every word you say
    Tear us apart / Baby I would rather be dead

Ooh ... .... ...
Oh you're the best
