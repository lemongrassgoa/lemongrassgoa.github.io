Somewhere over the rainbow, way  up    high,
G/B     Gm/Bb   D/A         B7    B-7   Em7/B  /Bb  A7    D   A7s
There's a       land that I heard of  / once,  in a lulla-by.
D   Bm    F#m          D7   G    G#-7  D    Am7>D7s
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

And   the    dreams that you dare to   dream  really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star,
  A7/Bb    /B         /C         /C#   DM7  Eb-7  Em  A7s>A+
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
    D/E       /D        /C#    /B
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
C#7                                 F#m   F+     Em7  A7(+)
Away above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me.

D   Bm7   F#m7          D7  G/B    G#-7  D/A    Am7>D7s
Somewhere over the rainbow, blue - birds   fly.
G/B   Gm/Bb  D/A  C7     B7   Eb-  Em7/B  Bb-     A7s       D
Birds fly    ov - er the rain-bow; Why,   then oh why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly
A7/C       /C#    /D   /D#     Em7   A7s    D
beyond the rainbow, why, oh why can't I?
