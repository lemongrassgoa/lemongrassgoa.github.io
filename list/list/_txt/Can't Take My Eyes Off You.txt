Can't Take My Eyes Off You

[Intro]   D7/C       Dm7/C      CM7   |  x2
 
                C                               CM7
You're just too good to be true / Can't take my eyes off you
              C7                        F
You'd be like heaven to touch / I wanna hold you so much
        Fm                                  C
At long last love has arrived / And I thank God I'm alive.
                D7/C            Dm7/C             CM7
You're just too good to be true / Can't take my eyes off you

           C                                  CM7
Pardon the way that I stare / There's nothing else to compare
             C7                                F
The sight of you leaves me weak / There are no words left to speak
           Fm                             C
But if you feel like I feel / please let me know that it's real
                D7              Dm7             CM7
You're just too good to be true / Can't take my eyes off you
