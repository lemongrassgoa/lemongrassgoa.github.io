Elton John
Your Song Capo 3

INTRO:   C   F/C    G/C   F/C

         C    FM7    G/B    Em   /   Am    Am7    Am6    F 
VERSE 1: It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
         I'm not one of those who can easily hide
         C/G    G    E    Am   /   C    Dm    F    G(s4)
         I don't much money, but, boy if I did
		 I'd buy a big house where we both could live

         C    FM7    G/B    Em   /   Am    Am7    Am6    F 
VERSE 2: If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
		 Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
         C/G    G    E    Am   /   C    Dm    F    C(s4)
         I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
		 My gift is my song, and this one's for you
         
         G/B    Am    Dm    F   /   G/B    Am    Dm    F
REFRAIN: And you can tell everybody this is your song
		 It may be quite simple but now that it's done
         Am    Am7    Am6   F6
         I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
		 That I put down in words
             C/E       F6            F             G    Gsus4   G 
         How wonderful life is while you're in the world

VERSE 3: I sat on the roof, and kicked off the moss
         Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
         C/G    G    E    Am   /   C    Dm    F    G(s4)
         But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
         It's for people like you that they keep it turned on
         
         C    FM7    G/B    Em   /   Am    Am7    Am6    F 
VERSE 4: So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
         You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
         C/G    G    E    Am   /   C    Dm    F    C(s4)
         Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
         Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
