Lonely No More

Verse 1:
Em                                Am
     Now it seems to me, That you know just what to say
G/Cmaj7             F#/Em+7
     Words are only words, Can you show me something else
Em                                    Am
     Can you swear to me, That you'll always be this way
G/Cmaj7              F#/Em+7
     Show me how you feel, More than ever baby
 
Chorus:
Em                Am             D                      F#/Em+7
 I don't wanna be lonely no more, I don't wanna have to pay for this
Em                        Am          D                     F#/Em+7
 I don't want to know the lover at my door, Is just another heartache on my list
Em                Am            D                       F#/Em+7
 I don't wanna be angry no more, You know I could never stand for this
 
Em                            Am              D
       F#/Em+7
 So when you tell me that you love me now for sure, I don't wanna be lonely anymore
Em          Am          D      F#/Em+7
 Oooh oh oh, Oooh oh oh, Oh oh, Oooh oh-ooo-oh oh
Em          Am          D      F#/Em+7
 Oooh oh oh, Oooh oh oh, Oh oh, Oooh oh-ooo-oh oh
 
Verse 2:
Em                                Am
    Now it's hard for me, With my heart still on the mend
G/Cmaj7        F#/Em+7
    Open up to me, Like you do your girlfriends
Em                                 Am
    And you sing to me, And it's harmony, Girl what you do to me is everything
 
G/Cmaj7                                        F#/Em+7
Make me say anything Just to get you back again, Why can't we just try
 
 
(Chorus:)

Bridge: (single strum, slow)
              Am                            Em
What if I was good to you, What if you were good to me
                Am                              Em
What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me
              Am                         Em
What if I was paradise, What if we were symphonies
    G/Cmaj7                       F#/Em+7
And what if I gave all my life to find someone to stand beside you
 
 
(Chorus) (Then end on an) Em.
