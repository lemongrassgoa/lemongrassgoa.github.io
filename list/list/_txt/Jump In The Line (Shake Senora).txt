My girl's name is Senora
I tell you friends, I adore her
And when she dances, oh brother!
She's a hurricane in all kinds of weather

Jump in the line
Rock your body in time

You can talk about cha-cha
Tango, waltz or the rumba
Senora's dance has no title
You jump in the saddle, hold on to the bridle

The reason for aviation
And fellas, you got to watch it
When she wind up, she bottom, she go like a rocket

Jump in the line
Rock your body in time

Hoist those skirts a little higher!

Jump in the line

Up the chimney!

Senora dances Calypso
Left to right is the tempo
And when she gets the sensation
She go up in the air, come down in slow motion
