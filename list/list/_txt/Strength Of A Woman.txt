So amazing how this world was made
I wonder if God is a woman
The gift of life astounds me till this day
I give it up for the woman
She's the constant wind that fills my sail / Oh that woman
With her smile and her style
She'll protect you like a child / That's a woman
         
    She'll put a smile upon your face
    And take you to that higher place
    So don't you underestimate / The strength of a woman
    The strength of a woman
         
Woke up this morning / I got up with the scent of a woman
Just picture if you would what life would be
Ain't much good without a woman
She can nag and be a constant pain / Oh that woman
But those hips she's got me whipped
And it's just to hard to resist / What a woman
         
    She'll put a smile upon your face
    And take you to that higher place
    So don't you underestimate / The strength of a woman
    The strength of a woman

(BRIDGE)
[F] Tender lips that's so so sweet
[G] Gentle words she softly speaks
[F] Such an angel when we need
[G] God bless the ground beneath her feet

[F]  She can take you on a high
[G]  Be your comfort when you cry
[Am] But if you look into her eyes
[F]  You'll see the [G7s4] strength of a woman [C]
         
    She'll put a smile upon your face
    And take you to that higher place
    So don't you underestimate / The strength of a woman
    The strength of a woman
