Rockabye
Clean Bandit

She works the night, by the water
She's gonna stress, so far away from her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come / She's got to save him

    She tells him "ooh love"
    No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
    I'm gonna give you all of my love
    Nobody matters like you
    She tells him "your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life
    You're gonna grow and have a good life
    I'm gonna do what I've got to do"

    So, rockabye baby, rockabye / I'm gonna rock you
    Rockabye baby, don't you cry / Somebody's got you
    Rockabye baby, rockabye / I'm gonna rock you
    Rockabye baby, don't you cry / Rockabye, no
    Rockabye, yeah, yeah

Single mom what you doing out there?
Facing the hard life without no fear
Just see and know that you really care
'Cause any obstacle come you well prepared
And no mamma you never shed tear
'Cause you haffi set things year after year
And you give the youth love beyond compare
You find the school fee and the bus fare
Hmmmm more when paps disappear
In a wrong bar can't find him nowhere
Steadily you work flow, heavily you know so you nah stop
No time no time fi a jeer

Now she gotta a six year old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks her in the eyes
He don't know he's safe when she says

    She tells him "ooh love"
    No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
    I'm gonna give you all of my love
    Nobody matters like you

    So, rockabye baby, rockabye / I'm gonna rock you
    Rockabye baby, don't you cry / Somebody's got you
    Rockabye baby, rockabye / I'm gonna rock you
    Rockabye baby, don't you cry / Rockabye, no
    Rockabye, yeah, yeah

Rockabye don't bother cry
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky, yo
Rockabye don't bother cry
Angels around you, just joy your eye

Now she gotta a six year old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep all the cold
When he looks her in the eyes
He don't know he's safe when she says

    She tells him "ooh love"
    No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
    I'm gonna give you all of my love
    Nobody matters like you
