Write You A Song Capo 2

        E                        B
I don't know how to make lots of money
I got debts that I'm trying to pay
        A                         E           C#m
I can't buy you nice things, like big diamond rings
    F#m                     B
But that don't mean much anyway
        E                              B
I can't give you the house you've been dreaming
If I could I would build it alone
       A                       E          C#m
I'd be out there all day, just hammering away
F#m                    B
Make us a place of our own

    C#m    A           E
    I will write you a song
    C#m               A            E             B
    That's how you'll know that my love is still strong
    C#m    A           E
    I will write you a song
               F#m                        E             B          E
    And you'll know from this song that I just can't go on without you

        E                         B
I don't know that I'd make a good soldier
I don't believe in being violent and cruel
        A                           E            C#m
I don't know how to fight, but I'll draw blood tonight
   F#m                    B
If somebody tries hurting you

    C#m    A           E
    I will write you a song
    C#m               A            E             B
    That's how you'll know that my love is still strong
    C#m    A           E
    I will write you a song
               F#m                        E             B          E
    And you'll know from this song that I just can't go on without you

(BRIDGE)
A             E          B                      A
Now that it's out on the table (it's out on the table)
A          E         B               A
Both of us knew all along (knew all along)
A             E          B             C#m
I've got your loving and you've got my song   --> (instrumental refrain)

        E                         B
I don't know how to make lots of money
I don't know all the right things to do
        A                           E           C#m
I can't say where we'll go, but the one thing I know
   F#m                     B
is how to be a good man to you
Until I die that's what I'll do

    C#m    A           E
    I will write you a song
    C#m               A            E             B
    That's how you'll know that my love is still strong
    C#m    A           E
    I will write you a song
               F#m                        E             B
    And you'll know from this song that I just can't go on without 
    C#m    A           E
    I will write you a song (I will write you a song)
    C#m               A            E             B
    That's how you'll know that my love is still strong (love is still strong)
    C#m    A           E
    I will write you a song 
               F#m                        E             B              E
    And you'll know from this song that I just can't go on ... without you
