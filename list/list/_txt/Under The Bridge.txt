Sometimes I feel like I don't have a part-ner
E           B         C#m     A
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
       E      B            C#m     G#m  A
Is the city I live in, the city of an - gels
E         B       C#m       A      EM7
Lonely as I am, together we cry

  E            B              C#m         G#m   A
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my compan - ion
  E                B                C#m         A
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
E                B             C#m       G#m   A
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me win - dy
     E       B         C#m       A     EM7
Well I never worry now that is a lie

    F#m7    E     B    F#m
    I don't ever wanna feel / Like I did that day           |
    But take me to the place I love / Take me all the way   |  x2

     E         B                  C#m    G#m  A
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out  there
     E         B          C#m      A
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
   E            B             C#m      G#m   A
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
E         B       C#m       A      EM7
Lonely as I am, together we cry

    F#m7    E     B    F#m
    I don't ever wanna feel / Like I did that day           |
    But take me to the place I love / Take me all the way   |  x2

Under the bridge downtown / is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown / I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown / Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown / I gave my life away
