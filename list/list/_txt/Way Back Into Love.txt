Hugh Grant
Way Back Into Love Capo 3

(INTRO)
G    Em     G   Em
Am   D7s4   Am  D7s4

G           Em
I've been living with a shadow overhead
I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed
Am          D
I've been lonely for so long
Trapped in the past, I just can't seem to move on

G           Em
I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away
Just in case I ever need ‘em again someday
Am          D
I've been setting aside time
To clear a little space in the corners of my mind

    G             Em           C             G
    All I want to do is find a way back into love
    I can't make it through without a way back into love
          D    Dsus4/G   D
    Oh oh oh

G           Em
I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine
I've been searching but I just don't see the signs
Am          D
I know that it's out there
There's got to be something for my soul somewhere

G           Em
I've been looking for someone to shed some light
Not just somebody just to get me through the night 
Am          D
I could use some direction
And I'm open to your suggestions

    G             Em           C             G
    All I want to do is find a way back into love
    I can't make it through without a way back into love
    D7(s4)       .......        G
    And if I open my heart again
    I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end

(INTERLUDE)
    G    Em     G   Em
    Am   D7s4   Am  D7s4

G           Em
There are moments when I don't know if it's real
Or if anybody feels the way I feel
Am          D
I need inspiration
Not just another negotiation

    G             Em           C             G
    All I want to do is find a way back into love
    I can't make it through without a way back into love

[D7s4] And if I open my heart to you
[Em]   I'm hoping you'll show me what to do
[Am7]  And if you help me to start again
[D7s4] You know that I'll be there for you in the end

(OUTRO)
    G    Em     G   Em
    Am   D7s4   Am  D7s4
