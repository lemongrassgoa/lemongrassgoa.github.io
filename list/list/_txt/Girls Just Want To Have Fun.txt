Girls Just Want To Have Fun (orig B)

[G]     Come home in the morning light
[Em]    My mother says "When you gonna live your life right?"
[Cadd9] Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones

    |   Em         D          Cadd9
    And girls they wanna have fun
    Ohh girls just wanna have fun

[G]     The phone rings in the middle of the night
[Em]    My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
[Cadd9] Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one

    |   Em         D          Cadd9
    But girls they wanna have fun
    Ohh girls just wanna have fun

[G]     That's all they really want
[Em]    Some fun
[Cadd9] When the working day is done

    |  Em          D          Cadd9
    Oh girls, they wanna have fun
    Oh girls just  wanna have fun

[G]     Some boys take a beautiful girl
[Em]    And hide her away from the rest of the world
[Cadd9] I want to be the one to walk in the sun

    |   Em         D          Cadd9

[Em]    Some fun
[Cadd9] When the working day is done
