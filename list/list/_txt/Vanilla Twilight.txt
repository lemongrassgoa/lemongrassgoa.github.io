Vanilla Twilight
Owl City (orig Bb)

| C   Gs4   Am   F  /  C   G   Dm   F
The stars lean down to kiss you
And I lie awake and miss you
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere
'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly
But I'll miss your arms around me
I'd send a postcard to you, dear
'Cause I wish you were here

| C   Gs4   Am   F  /  C   G   Dm   F
I'll watch the night turn light blue
But it's not the same without you
Because it takes two to whisper quietly
The silence isn't so bad
'Till I look at my hands and feel sad
'Cause the spaces between my fingers
Are right where yours fit perfectly

| C   G   Am   F  /  C   G   Dm   F
I'll find repose in new ways
Though I haven't slept in two days
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone
But drenched in vanilla twilight
I'll sit on the front porch all night
Waist deep in thought because when
I think of you (I don't feel so alone) x3

As many times as I blink / I'll think of you tonight

[C/E   Fs2   Gs4   % ]   x4
I'll think of you tonight

| D   A    Bm   G  /  D   A   Em7   G
When violet eyes get brighter
And heavy wings grow lighter
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again
And I'll forget the world that I knew
But I swear I won't forget you
Oh if my voice could reach back through the past
I'd whisper in your [A] ear:
"Oh darling, I wish you were here"

But I swear I won't forget you
Oh if my voice could reach back through the past
I'd whisper in your [B] ear:
