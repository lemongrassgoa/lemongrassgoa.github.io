Cliff Richard and The Shadows
Living Doll (orig. A)

    Got myself a cryin', talkin'
    Sleepin', walkin', livin' doll
    I got to do my best to please her
    Just 'cos she's a livin' doll
    I got a rovin' eye
    And that is why, she satisfies my soul
    I got the one and only, walkin', talkin', livin' doll

So take a look at her hair, it's real
And if you don't believe what I say, just feel
Gonna lock her up in a trunk
So, no big hunk can steal her away from me

    Got myself a cryin', talkin'
    Sleepin', walkin', livin' doll
    I got to do my best to please her
    Just 'cos she's a livin' doll
    I got a rovin' eye
    And that is why she satisfies my soul
    Got the one and only, walkin', talkin', livin' doll

So take a look at her hair, it's real
An' if you don't believe what I say, just feel
I'm gonna lock her up in a trunk
So no big hunk can steal her away from me

    Got myself a cryin', talkin'
    Sleepin', walkin', livin' doll
    I got to do my best to please her
    Just 'cos she's a livin' doll
    I got a rovin' eye
    And that is why, she satisfies my soul
    Got the one and only, walkin', talkin', livin' doll
