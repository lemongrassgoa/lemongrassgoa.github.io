Genie In A Bottle

I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips / And blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby

|   Em    Am  B7
    Ooohhh, my body's sayin' let's go
|   Am    C7  B7
    Ooohhh, but my heart is sayin' no
    
|   Em    Am7    CM7     Am7  B7
    If you wanna be with me / Baby there's a price to pay
    I'm a genie in a bottle / You gotta rub me the right way
    If you wanna be with me / I can make your wish come true
    You gotta make a big impression (Oh yeah)
    Gotta like what you do
|   Em    Am7    B7        CM7 B7
    (I'm a genie in a bottle baby / Gotta rub me the right way honey)
    (I'm a genie in a bottle baby / Come come, come on and let me out)

| Em    Am7    B7    CM7 B7
The music's fading and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racing at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby, baby, baby

|   Em    Am  B7
    Ooohhh, my body's sayin' let's go
|   Am    C7  B7
    Ooohhh, but my heart is sayin' no
