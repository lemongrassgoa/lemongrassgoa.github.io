New Rules

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

    One: Don't pick up the phone
    You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
    Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again
    Three: Don't be his friend
    You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
    And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

    I got new rules, I count 'em
    I got new rules, I count 'em
    I gotta tell them to myself
    I got new rules, I count 'em
    I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

    One: Don't pick up the phone
    You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
    Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again
    Three: Don't be his friend
    You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
    And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

    I got new rules, I count 'em
    I got new rules, I count 'em
    I gotta tell them to myself
    I got new rules, I count 'em
    I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect, I'm still tryna learn it by heart
Eat, sleep and breathe it, rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I

    One: Don't pick up the phone
    You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
    Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again
    Three: Don't be his friend
    You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
    And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

    I got new rules, I count 'em
    I got new rules, I count 'em
    I gotta tell them to myself
    I got new rules, I count 'em
    I gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend, don't, don't, don't
You gettin' over him
