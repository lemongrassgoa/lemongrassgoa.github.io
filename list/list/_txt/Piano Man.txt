It's nine o'clock on a Saturday / The regular crowd shuffles in
C     C/B     F/A     C/G     F     G7s     C     %
There's an old man sitting next to me / Makin' love to his tonic and gin

C     C/B     F/A     C/G     F     G7s     C     /B
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete / When I wore a younger man's clothes"

C     C/B     F/A     C/G     F     G7s     C     %    F/C    G/C
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke / But there's someplace that he'd rather be
C     C/B     F/A     C/G     F     C/E     D7     G
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me." / As the smile ran away from his face

Now Paul is a real estate novelist / Who never had time for a wife

And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy / And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practising politics / As the businessmen slowly get stoned
C     C/B     F/A     C/G     F     G7s     C     /B
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness / But it's better than drinkin' alone

'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see / To forget about life for a while

And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar / And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"
