INTRO:  | Bm      G       D       A
        | Bm      G       F#m7    Em7

| Bm      G       D       A
So sweet, so beautiful
Everyday like a queen on her throne
No, nobody knows how she feels
Aicha, lady one day it will be real

| Bm      G       D       A
She moves, she moves like a breeze
| Bm      G       F#m7    Em7
I swear I can't get her out of my dreams
| Bm      G       D       A
To have her shining right here by my side
| Bm      G       F#m7    Em7
I'd sacrifice all them tears in my eyes

    | Bm      G       D       A
    Aicha Aicha - passing me by
    | Bm      G       F#m7    Em7
    Aicha Aicha - my my my
    | Bm      G       D       A
    Aicha Aicha - smile for me now
    | Bm      G       F#m7    Em7
    Aicha Aicha - in my life

| Bm      G       F#m7    Em7
She holds her child to her heart
| Bm      G       D       A
Makes her feel like she blessed from above
| Bm      G       F#m7    Em7
Falls asleep underneath her sweet tears
| Bm      G       D       A
Her lullaby fades away with his fears

    | Bm      G       D       A
    Aicha Aicha - passing me by
    Aicha Aicha - my my my

    | Em7       CM7
    She Needs somebody to lean on, lean on
    Someone body, mind and soul (body, mind and soul)
    | Am7       D
    To take her hand, to take her world
    | Bm        Em
    Show her the time of her life, so true
    | CM7       Em7
    Throw the pain away for good
    | B7
    No more contemplating boo / No more contemplating

| Bm      G       D       A
Lord knows the way she feels
| Bm      G       F#m7    Em7
Everyday in his name she begins
| Bm      G       D       A
To have her shining here by my side
| Bm      G       F#m7    Em7
I'd sacrifice all them tears in my eyes
| Bm      G       N.C.
