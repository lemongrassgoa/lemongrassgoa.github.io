Omi
Cheerleader (orig. E)    Capo 2 D

         
VERSE 1: When I need motivation / My one solution is my queen
         'Cause she stays strong / Yeah, yeah
         She is always in my corner / Right there when I want her
         All these other girls are tempting
         But I'm empty when you're gone
         And they say
         
LINK:    Do you need me? / Do you think I'm pretty?
         Do I make you feel like cheating?
         I'm like no, not really 'cause
         
REFRAIN: Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader    |
         She is always right there when I need her           |  x2
         
VERSE 2: She walks like a model / She grants my wishes
         Like a genie in a bottle / Yeah, yeah
         'Cause I'm the wizard of love / And I got the magic wand
         All these other girls are tempting
         But I'm empty when you're gone
         And they say

VERSE 3: She gives me love and affection / Baby, did I mention
         You're the only girl for me / No, I don't need a next one
         Mama loves you too / She thinks I made the right selection
         Now all that's left to do / Is just for me to pop the question
