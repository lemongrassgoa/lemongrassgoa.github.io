[Intro]
| Bm          Em    A  | x2
 
[Bm] Lucky you were born that far away so
[F#] So we could both make fun of distance
[G]  Lucky that I love a foreign land for
[D]  The lucky fact of [A] your existence

[Bm] Baby I would climb the Andes solely
[F#] To count the freckles on your body
[G]  Never could imagine there were only
[D]  Too many ways to [A] love somebody

[Em] Lo ro lo le lo le
[Bm] Lo ro lo le lo le
[G]  Can't you see... [N.C.] I'm at your feet
 
 
  | Bm        G         D               A
    Whenever, wherever / We're meant to be together
  | Bm                 G               Em              A
    I'll be there, and you'll be near / And that's the deal, my dear
  | Bm         G           D             A
    There over, hereunder / You'll never have to wonder
  | Bm            G           Em               A
    We can always play by ear / But that's the deal, my dear

| Bm    -    Em    A  | x2

[Bm] Lucky that my lips not only mumble
[F#] They spill kisses like a fountain
[G]  Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
[D]  So you don't confuse them [A] with mountains

[Bm] Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
[F#] To run for cover when I need it
[G]  And these two eyes that for no other
[D]  The day you leave, will [A] cry a river

[Em] Lo ro lo le lo le
[Bm] Lo ro lo le lo le
[G]  at your feet ... [A] I'm at your feet
 
 
  | Bm        G         D               A
    Whenever, wherever / We're meant to be together
  | Bm                 G               Em              A
    I'll be there, and you'll be near / And that's the deal, my dear
  | Bm         G           D             A
    There over, hereunder / You'll never have to wonder
  | Bm            G           Em               A
    We can always play by ear / But that's the deal, my dear
 
| Bm    -    Em    A  | x2
 
[Bridge] (single strums)
| Em                  Bm
Lo ro lo le lo le,   lo ro lo le lo le-e-ee
| G               A
think out loud, say it again
| Em                        Bm
Lo ro lo le lo le lo le   Tell me one more time
| G                  A            F#/A#   N.C. (4 beats)
that you'll live   lost in my eyes
 
 
  | Bm        G         D               A
    Whenever, wherever / We're meant to be together
  | Bm                 G               Em              A
    I'll be there, and you'll be near / And that's the deal, my dear
  | Bm         G           D              A
    There over, hereunder / You've got me head over heels
  | Bm              G           Em                        A
    There's nothing left to fear / if you really feel the way  I  feel

  | Bm        G         D               A
    Whenever, wherever / We're meant to be together
  | Bm                 G               Em              A
    I'll be there, and you'll be near / And that's the deal, my dear
  | Bm         G           D              A
    There over, hereunder / You've got me head over heels
  | Bm              G           Em                        A
    There's nothing left to fear / if you really feel the way  I  feel
