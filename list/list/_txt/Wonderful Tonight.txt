VERSE 1: It's late in the evening / She's wondering what clothes to wear
         She puts on her make up / And brushes her long blonde hair
         C               D         G       Bm/F#  Em
         And then she asks me / Do I look alright
                     C             D           G     D/F#  C  D
         And I say yes, you look wonderful tonight
         
         G   D/F#   C   D
VERSE 2: We go a party / And everyone turns to see
         This beautiful lady  / That's walking around with me
         C               D       G        Bm/F#  Em
         And then she asks me / Do you feel alright
                     C           D           G
         And I say yes, I feel wonderful tonight

BRIDGE:  I feel wonderful / Because I see the love light in your eyes
                 C            D                   C             D
         And the wonder of it all /   Is that you just don't realize
                     G        D/F#  C  D  G  D/F#  C  D
         How much I love you

VERSE 3: It's time to go home now / And I've got an aching head
         So I give her the car keys / She helps me to bed
         C             D        G      Bm/F#        Em
         And then I tell her / As I turn out the light
                     C                 D           G     Bm/F#  Em  Em/D
         I say my darling, you were wonderful tonight
                 C                 D           G
         Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight
