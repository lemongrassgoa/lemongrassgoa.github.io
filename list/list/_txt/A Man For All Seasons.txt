|   Dm                     G7
One eye on the shadows, protecting his fellows,
|    Dm7                         G7
From sun up till the moon on his back.
|        Dm                   G7   
Send the villains to Hades, a hit with the ladies
| Dm7              A7
a stallion, in the sack.
|   Dm                             DmM7
You can't get your life back, when right follows left Jack,
|   Dm7                        Dm6
The more you see, the less you know.

When others would leak it, his service is secret.
|     Bb7                       A7
Plays God when its your time to go.

    Queen and country safe and sound
|                                Dm/A
    with villains six feet under ground,
|                                   Am
    And no one knows cause no one's found
|                  Bb
    any trace of a man for all seasons.
|   F/A                       Gm        A7
    Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone, so alone
|/C                               Am/C
    And you and I wouldn't have a clue
|                                   Dm/A
    who's doing what, why, when and who
|                          Am
    up the creek with no canoe,
|                     Bb
    watch out for the man for all seasons
|   F/A                       Gm        A7
    loves 'em and leaves 'em alone, so alone (but safe at home)

From the House of Lords saving Norfolk broads,
| Dm7                G7
Commoners and land a gentry.
|   Dm                  G7   
His word is Bond with a brunette or blonde
| Dm7           A7
baby it's so elementary.
|       Dm                       DmM7
For the man never messed up your life with one stare,
|       Dm7                     Dm6
See the film you'll know how it goes
|   Dm            C#+      F/C            G7/B
But this ain't no fiction, just check the diction
|        Bb7          A7
quid pro quo, a pro's pro.

|   Dm               BbM7    
Hey fellas, don't be jealous

So charismatic, with an a automatic
|     Gm7                      A7
Never prematurely shooting his load (pow!)
