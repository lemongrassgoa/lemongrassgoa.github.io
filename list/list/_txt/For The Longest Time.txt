If you    said good bye to me tonight / There would    still be   music left to write

What else could I do / I'm so inspired by you

I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall / And the  greatest miracle of all

Is how I need you / And how you needed me too

    Maybe this wont last very long

    But you feel so right / And I could be wrong

    Maybe I've been hoping too hard

I'll take my chances / I forgot how nice romance is

I haven't been there for the longest time

    I had second thoughts at the start

    I said to myself / Hold on to your heart
    F#m            Bm
    Now I know the woman that you are

    You're wonderful so far / And it's more than I hoped for

D F#m   Bm7  D    G              D        D F#m  Bm7  D E        E7     A 
I don't care what consequence it brings / I have been a fool for lesser things
F#         Bm       A7          D        D7    
I want you so bad / I think you ought to know that

I intend to hold you for the longest time
