Sweet Sweet Smile
The Carpenters (orig. D)

[D] You're always in my heart
From [Bm] early in the morning till it's dark
I got to [G] see your sweet, sweet [F#m] smile [A] every [D] day
When I [D] wake up in the morning and I see you there
I [Bm] always whisper a little prayer
I got to [G] see your sweet, sweet [A] smile every [D] day

    I got to [Bm] know that you love me / And that you want me
    And that you'll always be there
    I got to [G] know / that you [A] care
    And I got to [Bm] feel your arms around me / And that you need me
    And you'll always be there
    I got to [G] know / that you [A] care

[D] If my times are bringing me down
[Bm] You're the only one that I want around
I got to [G] see your sweet, sweet [F#m] smile [A] every [D] day
[D] And if I'm all strung out
[Bm] You're the only one who can straighten me out
I got to [G] see your sweet, sweet [A] smile every [D] day

    I got to [Bm] know that you love me / And that you want me
    And that you'll always be there
    I got to [G] know / that you [A] care
    And I got to [Bm] feel your arms around me / And that you need me
    And you'll always be there
    I got to [G] know / that you [A] care
