Antonio's Song (Capo 3) [drum: Bossa 2, bpm: 105]

INTRO: |  [Am7   %   Dm7   E7]    ...   Am7 - Em7

| Am7                  Dm7     Am7               A7
  Antonio lives life's frevo / Antonio prays for truth
| Dm7              Am7               Bm7(b5)        E7(sus)
  Antonio says our friendship / Is a hundred-proof
| Am7                      Dm7   Am7                A7
  The vulture that circles Rio / Hangs in this L.A. sky
| Dm7                        Am7            Bm7(b5)        Em7-E7
  The blankets they give the Indians / Only make them die

|                Am7                     Dm7
    But sing the song / Forgotten for so long 
|               /C    Bm7(b5)     E7             Am7     Dm7 E7
    And let the music flow / Like light into the rainbow 
|               Am7                                Dm7
    We know the dance / we have, we still have the chance 
|                  /C         Bm7(b5)     E7             Am7     Dm7 E7
    To break these chains and flow / Like light into the rainbow

| Am7               Dm7      Am7               A7
  Antonio loves the desert / Antonio prays for rain 
| Dm7                Am7               Bm7(b5)        E7(sus)
  Antonio knows that pleasure / Is the child of pain 
| Am7                Dm7         Am7                 A7
  And lost in la Califusa / When most of my hope was gone 
| Dm7             Am7             Bm7(b5)      Em7-E7
 Antonio's samba led me / To the Amazon

|                Am7                     Dm7
    But sing the song / Forgotten for so long 
|               /C    Bm7(b5)     E7             Am7     Dm7 E7
    And let the music flow / Like light into the rainbow 
|               Am7                                Dm7
    We know the dance / we have, we still have the chance 
|                  /C         Bm7(b5)     E7             Am7     Dm7 E7
    To break these chains and flow / Like light into the rainbow
