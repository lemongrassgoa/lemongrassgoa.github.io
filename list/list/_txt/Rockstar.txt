Rockstar [rhythm: Rock 5, bpm: 72]
 
| G       C       F       G
I'm through with standing in line to clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be
(tell me what you want)

| G       C       F       G
I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me
(ah, so what you need?)
 
| G       C       F       G
I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty seven thousand feet
(been there, done that)

| G       C       F       G
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me
(so how you gonna do it?)
 
    I'm gonna [Bb] trade this life for fortune and fame
    I'd even [C] cut my hair and change my name
 
    'Cause we [G] all just wanna be big rockstars
    And live in [Bb] hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
    The [C] girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
    We'll [Eb] all stay skinny 'cause we [F] just won't eat
    
    And we'll [G] hang out in the coolest bars
    In the [Bb] VIP with the movie stars
    Every [C] good gold digger's gonna wind up there
    Every [Eb] Playboy bunny with her [F] bleach blond hair
 
  | Bb   C                     G
    Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar     |  x2
 
| G       C       F       G
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free
(I'll have a quesadilla)

| G       C       F       G
I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me
(so how you gonna do it?)
 
    I'm gonna [Bb] trade this life for fortune and fame
    I'd even [C] cut my hair and change my name
 
    'Cause we [G] all just wanna be big rockstars

    The [C] girls come easy and the drugs come cheap

    Every [C] good gold digger's gonna wind up there
    Every [Eb] Playboy bunny with her [F] bleach blond hair
 
    And we'll [G] hide out in the private rooms
    With the [Bb] latest dictionary and today's who's who
    They'll [C] get you anything with that evil smile
    Every [Eb] body's got a drug dealer [F] on speed dial and
    
  | Bb   C                     G
    Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

(BRIDGE)
I'm gonna [Eb] sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna [Bb] pop my pills from a pez dispenser
I'll get [Eb] washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip [C] sync 'em every night so I don't [F] get 'em wrong ...

    'Cause we [G] all just wanna be big rockstars
    And live in [Bb] hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
    The [C] girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
    We'll [Eb] all stay skinny 'cause we [F] just won't eat
    
    And we'll [G] hang out in the coolest bars

    And we'll [G] hide out in the private rooms
    With the [Bb] latest dictionary and today's who's who
    They'll [C] get you anything with that evil smile
    Every [Eb] body's got a drug dealer [F] on speed dial and

    Bb   C                     G
    Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar     |  x2
