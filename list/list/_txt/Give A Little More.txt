Give A Little More (orig Dm) [rhythm: Groove 1, bpm: 120]

| Dm      Gm
Now you've been bad, and it goes on and on and on
'til you come home babe, 'til you come home
You taste best, the poison I've learned to love is gone.
I'm all alone baby, I'm all alone

    | Dm    %    Gm    %    BbM7     A7
    I'm waiting for something, always waiting
    Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
    And then I give a little more, oh babe ohhh
    Give a little more, oh babe ohhh

    I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
    I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
    'til I get a little more from you baby ohhh
    Get a little more from you baby

| Dm      Gm
You were wrong for turning me on and on and on
And on and on
You make it so hard

    | Dm    %    Gm    %    BbM7     A7
    I'm waiting for something, always waiting
    Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
    And then I give a little more, oh babe ohhh
    Give a little more, oh babe ohhh

    I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
    I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
    'til I get a little more from you baby ohhh
    Get a little more from you baby

  | Bb/G   /A    /Bb     %                             B-        BbM7
    I      have   no     defense / I know you're gonna get me in the end
  | Bb/G   /A    /Bb     %                      B-            A7/C#
And I      can - not pre-tend / I never want to feel this way again ohhh

| Dm    %    Gm    %    BbM7     A7
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'til I get a little more from you baby ohhh
Get a little more from you baby

| Dm    %    Gm    %    BbM7     A7
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'til I get a little more from you baby ohhh
Get a little more from you baby
