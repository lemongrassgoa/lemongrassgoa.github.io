Forget About Joni

C    Dm  /  F   G   C
Got to know where you stand
If you are going to try to make a move
She is standing alone with her girls 
and I don't think she minds
You better not give a damn
If you are going to be one of those dudes
I've seen a thousand come round
and she just shoots them all down with a cold shoulder

F    G    C    Am  /  F    G    C
So if you want my advice don't let it go to your head
She's the kind of a girl who wants a girl in her bed 
You could give her your heart she wants your sister's instead 
Better forget about Joni

C    Dm  /  F   G   C
Her black hair shines in the night
A fixture smile and she loves to tease
All the athletes and actors have called 
but she's never responded
She's got those jeans on so tight
She's half egyptian and half japanese
Each time she's batting an eye 
congressmen and senators cry / Oh mama help me

(REFRAIN)

Am     C     Am    G
J-J-J-J-J-Joni    |  x3
All the men want Joni so much
But she don't want the touch of a man

(instrumental)   C    Am  /  F   G   C

C    Dm  /  F   G   C
You're gonna know where you were
The very moment that you caught these blues
And you will lie awake all through your nights 
wondering what she's doing
Just look at me if your unsure
I've walked a thousand miles in your shoes
I'll spent the rest of my life 
back at this bar everynight trying to love her

(REFRAIN)
