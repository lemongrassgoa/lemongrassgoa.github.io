Big Bang
Rock Mafia ft Miley Cyrus (orig Gm)

|             Gm              Cm7
I don't wanna lie / I'm gonna take what you're giving
|      D7                         Gm
'Cause I know you're willing / To take me all the way
|          Cm7           Gm
You got me right here combustible.
|   A7                        D7
And I can't wait to finally explode.

|                Cm7                  Gm
    The big, big bang, the reason I'm alive,
|                         D7                        Gm
    When all the stars collide / In this universe inside.
|                Cm7   Gm    D7    Gm
    The big, big bang ...

|                   Gm         Cm7
Some people like to talk / But I'm into doing
|    D7                        Gm
What I feel like doing / When I'm inspired
|                Cm7           Gm
So, if we take a walk down the beach tonight,
| A7                             D7
I bet that we could light up the sky.

|                Cm7                  Gm
    The big, big bang, the reason I'm alive,
|                         D7                        Gm
    When all the stars collide / In this universe inside.
|                Cm7   Gm    D7    Gm
    The big, big bang  ...          (Take it from me ...)

| G                                  Cm
Take it from me / I don't wanna be / Mummified
|           Cm7                 F
Sometimes I feel so isolated, I wanna die.
|        G                                Cm
And I'll take it from you, if you got it, every time
|        Cm7                   F                     D7/F#
So baby, bring your body here, next to mine, next to mine!

|                 Gm        Cm7
No, I don't wanna dream / I just wanna live it
|   D7              Gm
So, baby, let's not miss this thing!

|                Cm7                  Gm
    The big, big bang, the reason I'm alive,
|                         A7             D7   (bass)G - A - Bb - B
    When all the stars collide / In this universe inside.
|                Cm7   Gm    D7    Gm
    The big, big bang  ...
