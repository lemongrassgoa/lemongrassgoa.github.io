C                        D
So, so you think you can tell
            Am7                   G
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
                     D                       C
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
               Am7                        G
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
                    C                     D
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
              Am7               G
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
                 D               C
Cold comfort for change? Did you ex-change
                      Am7                      G
A walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

C                               D
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
           Am7                                     G
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year
D                               C
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
             Am                   G
The same old fears; Wish you were here.
