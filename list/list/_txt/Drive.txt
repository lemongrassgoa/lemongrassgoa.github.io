Drive [rhythm: 16th Shuffle, bpm: 100]

| Em    D6    CM7    Am7
Sometimes I feel the fear of the
uncertainty stinging clear
And I can't help but ask myself
how much I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer

    | CM7    A    CM7     A7
    It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague
    Haunting mass appeal
    Lately I'm beginning to find that I
    should be the one behind the wheel

    | Em    D6    CM7    Am7
    Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
    With open arms and open eyes, yeah
    Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there, I'll be there

| Em    D6    CM7    Am7
So if I decide to waiver my chance to be
one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
and hold my own and drive, oh oh

    | CM7    A    CM7     A7
    It's driven me before, and it seems to be the way
    That everyone else gets around
    Lately, I'm beginning to find that 
    when I drive myself, my light is found

    | Em    D6    CM7    Am7
    Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
    With open arms and open eyes, yeah
    Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there, I'll be there

| CM7    A    CM7     A7         
Would you choose water over wine ... hold the wheel and drive?

    | Em    D6    CM7    Am7
    Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
    With open arms and open eyes, yeah
    Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there, I'll be there
