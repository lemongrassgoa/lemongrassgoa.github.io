In the year of '39, assembled here the volunteers
|      F         C          G
In the days when lands were few
|        Am          Am/G         F
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
|   G/C                 C
The sweetest sight ever seen
|       G                           G#dim
And the night followed day, and the story tellers say
|        Am                  Dm
That the score brave souls inside
|   C                         G
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
| F            Am    F     G       F     C      G ....... 
  Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

    |         C                          F
    Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
    |         C               G
    Don't you hear me calling you
    |          C       E7/B     Am     G       F     Em        Dm  
    Write your letters in  the  sand / For the day I take your hand
    |      C/E           G             C
    In the land that our grandchildren knew

|      G                  Am
In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
|        F          C         G
The volunteers came home that day
|        Am         Am/G      F
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
|            G                 C
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
|       G                             G#dim
For the Earth is old and grey, little darling, we'll away
|      Am                Dm
But my love, this cannot be
|      C                               G
Oh, so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
|    F        Am    F         G     F      C     G ....... 
Your mother's eyes, from your eyes, cry to me

    |         C                          F
    Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
    |         C               G
    Don't you hear me calling you
    |          C       E7/B     Am     G       F     Em        Dm  
    Write your letters in  the  sand / For the day I take your hand
    |      C/E           G             C    G .....
    In the land that our grandchildren knew

|         C                          F
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
|         C               G
Don't you hear me calling you
|        C       E7/B     Am     G      F       Em        Dm  
All your letters in  the  sand / Cannot heal me like your hand
|      C/E           G           C
For my life / Still ahead / Pity me [N.C.]
