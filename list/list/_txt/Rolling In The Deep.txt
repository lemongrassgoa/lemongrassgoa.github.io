Rolling In The Deep
Adele (orig Cm)

| Am      Em       G    Em  G
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

| Am      Em       G    Em  G
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

| F    G     Em    F
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
| F    G     Em    E7
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

    | Am    G    F    G 
    We could have had it all
    Rolling in the deep
    You had my heart inside of your hand
    And you played it, to the beat
        (You're gonna wish you / never had met me)
        (Tears are gonna fall / rolling in the deep)

| Am      Em       G    Em  G
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

| F    G     Em    F            (you're gonna wish you .... )
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
| F    G     Em    E7
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
    
    | Am    G    F    G          (you're gonna wish you .... )
    We could have had it all
    Rolling in the deep
    You had my heart inside of your hand
    And you played it, to the beat

    | F    G    Am    G
    We could have had it all / rolling in the deep
    |                  F
    You had my heart inside of your hand
    |       G
    But you played it, with a beating

[percussion only]
Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

[quietly]
    | Am    G    F    G          (you're gonna wish you .... )
    We could have had it all
    We could have had it all
    It all, it all, it all

    | Am    G    F    G          (you're gonna wish you .... )
    We could have had it all
    Rolling in the deep
    You had my heart inside of your hand
    And you played it, to the beat

    | Am    G    F    G          (you're gonna wish you .... )
    We could have had it all
    Rolling in the deep
    You had my heart inside of your hand
    But you played it, you played it
    you played it, you played it to the beat.
