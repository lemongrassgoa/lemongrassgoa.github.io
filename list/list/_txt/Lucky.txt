G      Em7      Am7       D7s4   /   B7       Em        Am7      D7     (Ebo)

Do you hear me, I'm talking to you / Across the water across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky, oh my, baby I'm trying
Boy, I hear you in my dreams / I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart / You make it easier when life gets hard

Em   Am7   D7   GM7 / Em7   Am7   D7(s4) / G   Em   Bm   D

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend / Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again / Ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Am7   Em   D7   Am

They don't know how long it takes / Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye / I wish we had one more kiss
I'll wait for you, I promise you, I will  D   Em7   D7/F#   B7/Eb

Em   Am7   D7   GM7 / Em7   Am7   D7(s4)

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend / Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way / Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

G      Em7      Am7       D7s4   /   B7       Em        Am7      D7     (Ebo)

And so I'm sailing through the sea / To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air / I'll put a flower in your hair
Though the breezes through the trees / Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round / You hold me right here right [B7/Eb]now

Em   Am7   D7   GM7 / Em7   Am7   D7(s4)

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend / Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way / Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

G   Em   Bm   D
Ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh / Ooooh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
