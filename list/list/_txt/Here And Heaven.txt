The Goat Rodeo Sessions
Here Amd Heaven

With a hammer and nails and a fear of failure
We are building a shed
Between here and Heaven
Between the wait and the wedding
For as long as we both shall be dead
To the world beyond the boys and the girls
Trying to keep us calm
We can practice our lines
'til we're deaf and blind
To ourselves to each other where it's
Fall not winter, spring not summer, cool not cold
And it's warm not hot
Have we all forgotten that we're getting old

With an arrow and bow and some seeds left to sow
We are staking our claim
On ground so fertile we forget who we've hurt along
The way and reach out for a strange hand to hold
Someone strong but not bold enough
To tear down the wall
Cause we ain't lost enough to find the stars ain't
Crossed why align them why fall
Hard not soft into
Fall not winter, spring not summer, cool not cold
Where it's warm not hot
Have we all forgotten that we're getting old

And it's fall not winter, spring not summer, cool not cold
And it's warm not hot
Has everyone forgotten that we're getting old

And it's fall not winter, spring not summer, cool not cold
And it's warm not hot
Have we all forgotten that we're getting old
