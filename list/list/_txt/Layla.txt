Dm   Bb   C   Dm   ...  Am  C

C#m                             G#7
What will you do when you get lonely 
C#m         C       D       E    E7
With nobody waiting by your side
F#m         B           E               A
You've been running and hiding much too long
F#m           B                 E
You know it's just your foolish pride

    Am  Dm  Bb     C            Dm
    Lay-la,    you got me on my knees
    Am  Dm  Bb     C               Dm 
    Lay-la,    I'm begging darling please
    Am  Dm  Bb     C                 Dm      Am      Dm   Bb   C   (Am)
    Lay-la,        darling won't you ease my worried mind

C#m                    G#7
Tried to give you consolation
C#m          C         D       E    E7
And your old man won't let you down
F#m    B       E                 A
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
F#m        B                  E
Turned the whole world upside down

    Am  Dm  Bb     C            Dm
    Lay-la,    you got me on my knees
    Am  Dm  Bb     C               Dm 
    Lay-la,    I'm begging darling please
    Am  Dm  Bb     C                 Dm      Am      Dm   Bb   C   (Am)
    Lay-la,        darling won't you ease my worried mind

C#m                              G#7
Let's make the best of the situation
C#m      C       D    E    E7
Before I finally go insane
F#m          B         E            A
Please don't say we'll never find a way
F#m         B                E   
And tell me all my love's in vain

    Am  Dm  Bb     C            Dm
    Lay-la,    you got me on my knees
    Am  Dm  Bb     C               Dm 
    Lay-la,    I'm begging darling please
    Am  Dm  Bb     C                 Dm      Am      Dm   Bb   C   (Am)
    Lay-la,        darling won't you ease my worried mind
