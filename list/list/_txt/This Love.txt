I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

    | Bm7     Em7     A7     DM7
    This love has taken its toll on me
    She said goodbye too many times before
    Her heart is breaking in front of me
    | Bm7     E7            Em7             C#-
    I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

    | Bm7     Em7     A7     DM7
    This love has taken its toll on me
    She said goodbye too many times before
    Her heart is breaking in front of me
    | Bm7     E7            Em7             C#-

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
My pressure on your hips / Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

    This love has taken its toll on me
