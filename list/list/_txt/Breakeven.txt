The Script
Breakeven (Capo 3) orig Eb

INTRO:  C   G   D   Em   x4
         
         Em   D   G   Am7 
VERSE 1: I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
         Just prayed to a god that I don't believe in 
         Cos I got time while she got freedom
         Cos when a heart breaks no it don't break even
         
VERSE 2: Her best days will be some of my worst 
         She finally met a man that's gonna put her first
         While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping
         Cos when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even, no
         
         C   G   D   Em
REFRAIN: What am I supposed to do when
         the best part of me was always you, and
         What am I supposed to say when
         I'm all choked up that you're OK, yeah
         I'm falling to pieces, yeah 
         I'm falling to pieces 
         
         Em   D   G   Am7 
VERSE 3: They say bad things happen for a reason 
         But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding
         Cos she's moved on while I'm still grieving 
         And when a heart breaks no it don't break even (even, no)

(REFRAIN)  C   G   D   Em
...
I'm falling to pieces  (One still in love while the other one's leaving)
I'm falling to pieces  (Cos when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)

[Instrumental]
Em   D   G   Am7  x2
         
         Em   D   G   Am7
BRIDGE:  You got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
         You took your suitcase, I took the blame. 
         Now I'm tryna make sense of what little remains, oh
         Cos you left me with no love, no love to my name. 
         
(VERSE 1)        
         
(REFRAIN)
...
I'm falling to pieces  (One still in love while the other one's leaving)
I'm falling to pieces  (Cos when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)
         
[Instrumental]
C   G   D   Em   x2 

[Outro]
Oh, it don't break even, no, oh
