Love Me Like You Do (orig G#)

G    Bm7    Em    Em7  []  CM7    D    Em   %
You're the light, you're the night / You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain / You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

G    Bm7    Em    Em7  []  CM7    D    Em   %
You're the fear, I don't care / 'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me to the dark /  et me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

         G    Bm7    Em    C  []  Am7    Em    Ds4    D
REFRAIN: So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
         Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
         Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
         What are you waiting for?

G    Bm7    Em    Em7    CM7    D    Em   %
Fading in, fading out / On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace / 'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

(REFRAIN)   x2
