Perfect
Ed Sheeran (orig. G#) [rhythm: 12/8 Simple 1, bpm: 95]

I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

| G - - - | Em7 - - - | Cadd9 - - - | G - D - |
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
| G - - - | Em7 - - - | Cadd9 - - - | D - - - |
Darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

    | Em7 - - - | Cadd9 - - - | G - - - | D - - - |
    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
    With you between my arms
    Barefoot on the grass
    Listening to our favourite song
    When you said you looked a mess
    I whispered underneath my breath
    But you heard it,
    Darling, you look perfect tonight
    | G   D/F#   Em   D   Cadd9      D      

| G - - - | Em7 - - - | Cadd9 - - - | D - - - |
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

| G - - - | Em7 - - - | Cadd9 - - - | G - D - |
We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
| G - - - | Em7 - - - | Cadd9 - - - | D - - - |
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

    | Em7 - - - | Cadd9 - - - | G - - - | D - - - |
    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
    With you between my arms
    Barefoot on the grass
    Listening to our favourite song
    When I saw you in that dress
    Looking so beautiful
    I don't deserve this
    Darling, you look perfect tonight

    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
    With you between my arms
    Barefoot on the grass
    Listening to our favourite song
    I have faith in what I see
    Now I know I have met an angel in person
    And she looks perfect
    I don't deserve this
    You look perfect tonight
