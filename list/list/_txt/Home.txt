Bm   D   D   G

Alabama, Arkansas / I do love my Ma and Pa
Not the way that I do love you
Well, holy moly me oh my / You're the apple of my eye
Girl, I've never loved one like you

Man, oh, man, you're my best friend / I scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothing that I need
Well, hot and heavy pumpkin pie / Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
Ain't nothing please me more than you

(REFRAIN)
Home, let me come home / Home is wherever I'm with you   |  x2

La la la la / Take me home    /    Mama, I'm coming home

I'll follow you into the park / Through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I've never loved one like you
Moats and boats and waterfalls / Alleyways and payphone calls
I been everywhere with you (that's true)

Laugh until we think we'll die / Barefoot on a summer night
Never could be sweeter than with you
And in the streets you run afree / Like it's only you and me
Geez, you're something to see.

Home, let me come home,
Home is wherever I'm with you
Our home, yes, I am home,
Home is when I'm alone with you
