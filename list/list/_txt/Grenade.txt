Grenade
Bruno Mars (orig Dm) (Capo 3)

[Dm ] Easy come, easy go / That's just how you live, oh
[Am7] Take, take, take it all / But you never give
[Dm ] Should've known you was trouble / From the first kiss
[Am7] Had your eyes wide open / [A7] Why were they open?

[Dm ] Gave you all I had / And you tossed it in the trash
[Am7] You tossed it in the trash, you did
[Dm ] To give me all your love is all I ever asked
[Bb ] 'Cause what you don't [A7] understand is...

    |              Dm            Bb    F     C
    I'd catch a grenade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
    Throw my hand on a blade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
    I'd jump in front of a train for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
    You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
    |           Bb                  C
    Oh, I would go through all this pain
    |      F               A7         Dm     (/C)
    Take a bullet straight through my brain
    |            Bbm7
    Yes, I would die for you, baby
    [A7] But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no

[Dm ] Black, black, black and blue / Beat me 'til I'm numb
[Am7] Tell the devil I said "Hey" when you get back to where you're from
[Dm ] Mad woman, bad woman / That's just what you are
[Am7] Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the [A7] brakes out my car

[Dm ] Gave you all I had / And you tossed it in the trash
[Am7] You tossed it in the trash, you did
[Dm ] To give me all your love is all I ever asked
[Bb ] 'Cause what you don't [A7] understand is...

    Yes, I would die for you, baby
    [A7] But you won't do the same

BRIDGE:  [Gm] If my body was on fire
         [Dm] Oh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
         [Gm] You said you loved me, you're a liar
         'Cause you [A7] never, ever, ever did
