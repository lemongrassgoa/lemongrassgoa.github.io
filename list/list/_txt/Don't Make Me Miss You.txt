Don't Make Me Miss You (orig. C#)

With a smile like yours I lay down my walls and just fall so easily
With a face like yours I can lose myself and go out my mind
It's not fair, I'm scared you'll leave me, yeah oh yeah

So if you see me on the side, please just walk on by
I don't want you to let me down, tasting tears of a clown
Please don't look my way and turn around and say hi
'Cause sooner or later you would say goodbye

    So before we start, let's just say that it's over
    Before I say those words and you give me the shoulder
    Don't want you to leave, but it's best if you don't make me miss you

With those puppy eyes you could tell me lies and I'd just believe you
With those angel kisses, daydreaming of us in a cathedral
I swear in your hands I'm putty, oh

So if you see my on the side, please just walk on by
I don't want you to let me down, tasting tears of a clown
Please don't look my way and turn around a say hi
'Cause sooner or later you would say goodbye

    So before we start, let's just say that it's over
    Before I say those words and you give me the shoulder
    Don't want you to leave, but it's best if you don't make me miss you

    I only have one heart and it's been broken before
    And it just can't take more fixing anymore
    Don't want you to leave, but it's best if you don't make me miss you

La-la-la-la
Don't make me miss you, oh yeah
Before we start

    So before we start, let's just say that it's over
    Before I say those words and you give me the shoulder
    Don't want you to leave, but it's best if you don't make me miss you
    
    I only have one heart and it's been broken before
    And it just can't take more fixing anymore
    Don't want you to leave, but it's best if you don't make me miss you
