Lifetime (orig D)

    D                     Bm
Oh, darling / There's not much that you can say
                Gs2                 A(s4)
To stop me from falling in / Like I am
    D              Bm
Oh, darling / Even waves can't wash away
    Gs2                       A(s4)
Our names in the sand / Never could, never can

               D     A                   Bm    D/F#
    You are my every-thing / I'd give up every-thing
                G                     D                    A(s4)
    Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
          D        A            Bm      D/F#
    Every dance is slow / Every kiss is woah
                 Gs2                        D
    They say you know when you know, well I know
                      As4
    I know you're the one

                Gs2                 As4
    Some people bring you a million blessings
                D           A/C#    Bm
    Some people teach you a million lessons
    A          G                    A                    Bm7
    All that I learned it wasn't my turn / It wasn't the right time
    D/F#        Gs2                     As4
    Some people come in your life for a reason
                D            A/C#       Bm      A
    Others they come in your life for a season
                G   A     D
    But baby, you are a lifetime


    D                    Bm
Oh, darling / There's no word that can describe
    Gs2               A(s4)
The way that I feel, tonight
    D                 Bm
Oh, darling / I would walk that broken road
Gs2                                   A(s4)
Time and time again / If it led me to your hello


               D     A                   Bm    D/F#
    You are my every-thing / I'd give up every-thing
                G                     D                    A(s4)
    Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
          D        A            Bm      D/F#
    Every dance is slow / Every kiss is woah
                 Gs2                        D
    They say you know when you know, well I know

    I know you're the one
