Simon and Garfunkel
Homeward Bound

|   A
I'm sitting in the railway station.
|     AM7                      A7   F#
Got a ticket for my destination  /  mmmm
| Bm                             G
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
|   A                                  E
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and one-man band.
 
    | A      D               A             D
    Homeward bound, I wish I was, homeward bound,
    | A            A/G
    Home, where my thought's escaping
    | A            A/G
    Home, where my music's playing,
    | A            A/G               E        A
    Home, where my love lies waiting silently for me.
 
| A
Ev'ry day's an endless stream
|  AM7                     A7   F#
Of cigarettes and magazines  /  mmmm
|   Bm                                  G
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
|   A                             E
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be
 
    | A      D               A             D
    Homeward bound, I wish I was, homeward bound,
    | A            A/G
    Home, where my thought's escaping
    | A            A/G
    Home, where my music's playing,
    | A            A/G               E        A
    Home, where my love lies waiting silently for me.
 
| A
Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
|    AM7                      A7   F#
I'll play the game and pretend  /  mmmm
|   Bm                              G
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
|    A                      E
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.
 
    | A      D               A             D
    Homeward bound, I wish I was, homeward bound,
    | A            A/G
    Home, where my thought's escaping
    | A            A/G
    Home, where my music's playing,
    | A            A/G               E        A
    Home, where my love lies waiting silently for me.
 
| AM7       A7       A
   Silently for me.
