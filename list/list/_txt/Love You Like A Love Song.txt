          Am
It's been said and done
      Dm7                        G7
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
      CM7                   FM7
And I guess right now here's another one
        Dm               Esus4               E7
So your melody will play on and on, with the best of 'em
  CM7              FM7
A sinful  miracle, lyrical
        Am                Dm7                 G7
You are beautiful, like a dream come alive, incredible
       Dm            Esus4         E7
You've saved my life again / And I want you to know baby

Constantly, boy you play through my mind like a symphony

There's no way to describe what you do to me

 I've been set free / I am hypnotized by your destiny
