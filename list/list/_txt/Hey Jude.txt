Hey Jude
The Beatles

| D    A    A7    D   /   G    D    A7    D
Hey Jude, don't make it bad / Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart / Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude, don't be afraid / You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin / Then you begin to make it better
         
        | D7                       G         Bm      Em
        And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
        |     D         A/C#    A7      D         Dmaj7 D7
        Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
        | D7                            G        Bm       Em 
        For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
        | D          A/C#    A7     D	
        By making his world a little colder
        Nah nah nah [D7] nah nah [A7] nah nah nah nah
         
| D    A    A7    D   /   G    D    A7    D
Hey Jude, don't let me down / You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart / Then you can start to make it better
         
        | D7                       G       Bm      Em
        So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
        |   D           A/C#    A7    D         Dmaj7 D7
        You're waiting for someone to perform with
        | D7                                G        Bm           Em
        And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
        |   D            A/C#    A7      D
        The movement you need is on your shoulder
        Nah nah nah [D7] nah nah [A7] nah nah nah nah
         
| D    A    A7    D   /   G    D    A7    D
Hey Jude, don't make it bad / Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin / Then you begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh
