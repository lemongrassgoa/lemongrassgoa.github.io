Koji (orig. E)

(fingerstyle)
|              D      D/C#     D/B         D/A
  Had we never come across the vastness of pavement
|     G/D           Em            G/D             A
  The barrenness of waves and the grayness of the sea
| D     D/C#    D/B        D/A
  Never lost or ne'er been misguided
| Em        G/D           Em      A     D  [hold 4 beats]
  We'd have ne'er reached seas so shi - ning
  
|    D         D/C#     D/B       D/A
  Or come from out of a hansom in Camden
|      G/D        Em               G/D              A
  To a bar in the basement / While all the while it rained
|    D     D/C#         D/B            D/A
  Or come around to the friendliest of faces
| Em      G/D    Em   A     D [interlude]
  Handsom-est in ugly pla - ces
  
    | D       D/C#        D/B     D/A
    | Em      G/D         Em      A
  
  (rhythm)
|    D         D/C#       D/B        D/A
  Or come from out of the tunnels we dig in
|             G/D             Em           G/D             A
  To see that tunneling's not living / And working doesn't work
|    D       D/C#      D/B         D/A
  Or come to find that loving is a labor
| Em      G/D      Em         A    D [interlude]
  Labor's life and life's for-ev - ver
  
    | D       D/C#        D/B     D/A
    | Em      G/D         Em      A
  
|    D       D/C#     D/B           D/A
  Or come to see that keeping's not giving
|     G/D             Em          G/D            A
  You get what you've given / You get what you deserve
| D          D/C#     D/B        D/A
  And in the midst of all of the action
| Em         G/D         Em    A     D  [hold 4 beats]
  Maybe only there found satis-fac - tion
  
    (menacing)
    [ Bm      Bb+     D/A     E/G# ]

    Chasing sea-foam dreams
    Around another dirty old town
    Parallel run streams
    Toward gray ocean from the green ground
    'Oed und leer, das meer
    But look beneath the glassy surface
    All the songs you hear
    Down there they have a purpose
  
    
    | D       D/C#       D/B     D/A
    | G/D     Em         G/D     A
    
  (together)
| D      D/C#     D/B         D/A
  All in all  we  cannot stop singing
|    G/D          Em           G/D           A
  We cannot start sinking / We swim until it ends
  
  (fingerstyle)
| D        D/C#     D/B       D/A
  They may kill and we may be parted
| Em          G/D      Em     A       D
  But we will ne'er be broken heart - ed
  
    | D       D/C#       D/B     D/A
    | G/D     Em         G/D     A      D
