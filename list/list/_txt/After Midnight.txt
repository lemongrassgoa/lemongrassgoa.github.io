After Midnight
J. J. Cale [drum: 16th shuffle 1, bpm: 90]

After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight, we're gonna chug-a-lug and shout

    We're gonna cause talk and suspicion
    Give an exhibition
    Find out what it is all about
    After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang out

After midnight, gonna shake your tambourine
After midnight, it's gonna be peaches and cream

    We're gonna cause talk and suspicion
    Give an exhibition
    Find out what it is all about
    After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang out
    
(SOLO)

    We're gonna cause talk and suspicion
    Give an exhibition
    Find out what it is all about
    After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang out
