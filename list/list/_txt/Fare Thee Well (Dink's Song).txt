Fare Thee Well (Dink's Song)

|        D          Gs2    D
If I had wings like Noah's dove
|  Ds2/C#   Bm7                Gs2
I'd fly the river to the one I love
|              D    Gs2   D      A         D      Gs2    D
Well fare thee well, my   honey, fare thee well

Well I had a man who was strong and tall
Who moved his body like a cannon ball
Well fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

I remember one evening, in the pourin' rain
And in my heart was an achin' pain
Well fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

(solo)

Muddy river runs muddy 'n' wild
Can't give a bloody for my unborn child
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

So show us a bird flyin' high above
Life ain't worth living without the one you love
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well  




























If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly up the river to the one I love
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

If I met your man, who was strong and tall
I'd hit his body like a cannon ball
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

One of these days and it won't be long
Call my name and I'll be gone
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

I remember one night, a drizzling rain
Round my heart I felt an achin' pain
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

When I wore my apron low
Couldn't keep you from my do'
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

Now I wear my apron high
Scarcely ever see you passing by
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

Now my apron's up to my chin
You pass my door and you won't come in
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

If I had listened to what my mama said
I'd be at home in my mama's bed
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
