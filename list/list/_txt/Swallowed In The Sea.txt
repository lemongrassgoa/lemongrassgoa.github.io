         D                 Ds2        Ds4                D
VERSE 1: You cut me down a tree / And brought it back to me
             D                   Ds2         Ds4
         And that's what made me see / Where I was going wrong
             D           Ds2         Ds4             D
         You put me on a shelf / And kept me for yourself
               D            Ds2            Ds4
         I can only blame myself / You can only blame me
          
             G/D             D        Bm/D          A/E
REFRAIN: And I could write a song / A hundred miles long
               G                D          D               A
         Well, that's where I belong / And you belong with me
             G/D              D         Bm/D           A
         And I could write it down / Or spread it all around
             G                 D          D                A    D
         Get lost and then get found / Or swallowed in the sea
         
             D           A          G              D
VERSE 2: You put me on a line / And hung me out to dry
             A                   G     G               D
         And darling that's when I / Decided to go see you
             D              A          G              D
         You cut me down to size / And opened up my eyes
         A          G           G           D
         Made me realize / What I could not see
         
             G               D          Bm                     A
REFRAIN: And I could write a book / The one, they'll say, that shook
             G                  D         D                 A
         The world, and then it took / It took it back from me
             G                D         Bm             A
         And I could write it down / Or spread it all around
             G                 D           D                   A
         Get lost and then get found / And you'll come back to me
             G                D
         Not swallowed in the sea

             G                      D      Bm              A
         The streets you're walking on / A thousand houses long
               G                D          D               A

            G              D          D              A
         Forget but not forgive / Not loving all you see
