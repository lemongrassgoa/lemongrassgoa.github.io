Lover Of The Light
Mumford and Sons

|            A                                    D
  And in the middle of the night, I may watch you go
|                A                                          D
  There'll be no value in the strength of walls that I have grown
|                Gs2            Bm           Bm    A    Gs2
  There'll be no comfort in the shade of the sha - dows thrown
|         A   D/A            A   D
  But I'd be  yours if you'd be  mine
  
|                D        Gs2      D
  Stretch out my life and pick the seams out
|               D         Gs2      A/D      Bm7
  Take what you like, but close my ears and eyes
| Gs2      D       A   D/A     A   D/A
  Watch me stumble o - ver and o - ver
  
|             D          Gs2        D
  I have done wrong, you build your tower
|             D        Gs2    A/D     Bm
  But call me home and I will build a throne
|     Gs2     D        A    D/A    A   D/A
  And wash my eyes out ne - ver    a - gain
  
    |                      Gs2                     A
      But love the one you hold / And I'll be your goal
    |                Bm7                   D
      To have and to hold / A lover of the light
  
|               D         Gs2       D
  With skin too tight and eyes like marbles
|             D        Gs2      A/D    Bm7
  You spin me high, so watch me as  I  glide
|   Gs2    D      A    D/A    A    D/A
  Before I tumble home-ward,  home-ward
  
|             D        Gs2     D
  I know I've tried, I was not stable
|           D        Gs2     A/D      Bm7
  Flawed by pride, I miss my sanguine eyes
|    Gs2     D         A       D/A      A       D/A
  So hold my hands up, breathe in  and  breathe out
  
    |                     Gs2                     A
      So love the one you hold / And I'll be your goal
    |                Bm7                   D
      To have and to hold / A lover of the light
      
| D      Bm       D       Bm
| D

|            A                                    D
  And in the middle of the night, I may watch you go
|                A                                          D
  There'll be no value in the strength of walls that I have grown
|                Gs2            Bm           Bm    A    Gs2
  There'll be no comfort in the shade of the sha - dows thrown
|             Gs2            Bm         Bm     A    Gs2
  You may not trust the promises of the change I'll show
|         A   D/A            A   D
  But I'd be  yours if you'd be  mine

    |                Bm7                   D
