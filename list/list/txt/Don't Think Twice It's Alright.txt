Bob Dylan
Don't Think Twice It's Alright (capo 3)

[Intro]
C   G   Am  %   /   F   C   G   C
 
   C               G              Am
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
F                    C  G
If you don't know by now
       C               G              Am
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
D7                   G      G7
It will never do somehow
          C                    C7
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
F                        D7
Look out your window and I'll be gone
C          G          Am        F
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
C           G               C   G
Don't think twice, it's all right
 
   C               G               Am
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
F                  C     G
That light I never knowed
       C               G               Am
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
D7                          G   G7
I'm on the dark side of the road
        C                                  C7
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
F                            D7
To try and make me change my mind and stay
C        G            Am         F
We never did too much talkin' anyway
C              G               C    G
So don't think twice, it's all right
 
   C               G              Am
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
F                     C   G
Like you never done before
   C               G              Am
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
D7                   G  G7
I can't hear you any more
      C                         C7
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walking down the road
F                       D7
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
C             G             Am        F
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
C               G               C   G
But don't think twice, it's all right
 
C       G     Am
So long honey babe
F                        C    G
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
C          G          Am
Goodbye is too good a word, babe
   D7                   G   G7
So I just say fare thee well
C                          C7
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
    F                          D7
You could have done better but I don't mind
C        G            Am          F
You just kinda wasted my precious time
C               G               C
But don't think twice, it's all right
