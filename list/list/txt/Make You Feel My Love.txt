VERSE 1: When the rain is blowing in your face
         And the whole world is on your case
         I could offer you a warm embrace
         To make you feel my love
         
VERSE 2: When the evening shadows and the stars appear
         And there is no one there to dry your tears
         I could hold you for a million years
         To make you feel my love

BRIDGE 1: I know you haven't made your mind up yet
          But I would never do you wrong
          C    G     A7       D7s4
          I've known it from the moment that we met
          No doubt in my mind where you belong
         
VERSE 3: I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
         I'd go crawling down the avenue
         No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
         To make you feel my love

BRIDGE 2: The storms are raging on the rolling sea
          And on the highway of regret
          C      G      Am7      D7s4
          The winds of change are blowing wild and free
          You ain't seen nothing like me yet
         
VERSE 4: I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
         Nothing that I wouldn't do
         Go to the ends of the Earth for you
         To make you feel my love
         To make you feel my love.
