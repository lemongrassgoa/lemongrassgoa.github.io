|        C    F    C    F  /   Am    F    G(s4)
VERSE 1: What will be left when I've drawn my last breath
         Besides the folks I've met and the folks who know me?
         Will I discover a soul saving love, or
         Just the dirt above and below me?
         
|              F        C      F  (/Bb)   C
REFRAIN: I'm a doubting Thomas / I took a promise
|        F        G        C     C/Bb
         but I do not feel safe
|        F/A         C/G   G   F  (intro theme)
         Oh, me of lit - tle faith

VERSE 2: Sometimes I pray for a slap in the face
         Then I beg to be spared 'cause I'm a coward
         If there's a master of death, I bet he's holding his breath
         As I show the blind and tell the deaf about his power

         ‘cause I don't know what's safe
|        F/A         C/G   G   F  (intro theme)
         Oh, me of lit - tle faith
     
BRIDGE:  [G#M7] Can I be used to help others find truth
         [Am7]  when I'm scared I'll find proof that it's a lie?
         [G#M7] Can I be lead down a trail dropping bread crumbs
         [Am7]  to prove I'm not ready to die? [Bb]

|        F/A         C  G   F  (intro theme)
         Oh, me of little faith  ...   oh, me of little faith
