This Magic Moment
The Drifters

This magic moment / So different and so new
Was like any other / Until I kiss you
And then it happened / It took me by suprise
I knew that you felt it too / By the look in your eyes

    Sweeter than wine
    Softer than the summer night
    Everything I want, I have
    Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment / While you lips are close to mine
Will last forever / Forever, 'til the end of time (magic)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (magic) (x4)

    Sweeter than wine
    Softer than the summer night
    Everything I want, I have
    Whenever I hold you tight
    
This magic moment / While you lips are close to mine
Will last forever / Forever, 'til the end of time (magic)

Oh-oh-oh-oh (magic)
Magic moment (magic)
Magic moment (magic)
Magic moment (magic)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (magic)
Oh, magic moment (magic)
