INTRO: | D

[D]   Clue number one was when you knocked on my door
[Em7] Clue number two was the look that you wore
[As4] And that's when I knew it was a pretty good sign
      That [G] something was wrong up on [D] cloud number nine

    Well it's a [A] long way up and we won't come down [D] tonight
    Well it [A] may be wrong but baby, it sure feels [G] right   [A]

    And the [D] moon is out and the stars are bright
    And [Em7] whatever come's gonna be alright
    'Cause [As4] tonight you will be mine / [G] up on [D] cloud number nine
    And there [D] ain't no place that I'd rather be
    And we [Em7] can't go back but you're here with me
    Yeah, the [As4] weather's really fine / [G] up on [D] cloud number nine

[D]   Now he hurt you and you hurt me
[Em7] And that wasn't the way it was supposed to be
[As4] So baby tonight let's leave the world behind
      And [G] spend some time up on [D] cloud number nine

    Well it's a [A] long way up and we won't come down [D] tonight
    Well it [A] may be wrong but baby, it sure feels [G] right   [A]

    And [Em7] whatever come's gonna be alright
    'Cause [As4] tonight you will be mine / [G] up on [D] cloud number nine
    And there [D] ain't no place that I'd rather be
    And we [Em7] can't go back but you're here with me
