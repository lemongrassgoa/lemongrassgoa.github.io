Chuck Berry
Johnny B Goode [rhythm: Simple 4, bpm: 180]

Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell

    Go go / Go Johnny go go
    Go Johnny go go / Go Johnny go go
    Go Johnny go go / Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by they would stop and say
"Oh my what that little country boy could play"

    Go go / Go Johnny go go
    Go Johnny go go / Go Johnny go go
    Go Johnny go go / Johnny B. Goode
    
(interlude)

His mother told him "someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying "Johnny B. Goode tonight"

    Go go / Go Johnny go go
    Go Johnny go go / Go Johnny go go
    Go Johnny go go / Johnny B. Goode
