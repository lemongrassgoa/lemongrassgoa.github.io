Let's Twist Again

Clap your hands! / All you looking good!
I'm goona sing my song / It won't take long!
We're gonna do the twist / And it goes like this:

Come on let's twist again / Like we did last summer!
Yeaaah, let's twist again / Like we did last year!
Do you remember when / Things were really hummin'
Yeaaaah, let's twist again / Twistin' time is here!

Heeee, and round and round and up and down we go again!
Oh, baby, make me know you love me sooooo, and then:
Twist again / Like we did last summer
Come on, let's twist again / Like we did last year!
TWIST! YO!

(interlude)

Who's that, flyin up there?
Is it a bird? Noooooo
Is it a plane? Noooooooo
Is it the twister? YEAAAAAAAHH!

Twist again / like we did last summer
Come on, Let's twist again / Like we did last year
Do you remember when / things were really hummin'
Come on, let's twist again / Twistin' time is here

Heeee, and round and round and up and down we go again!
Oh, baby, make me know you love me sooooo, and then:
Twist again / Like we did last summer
Come on, let's twist again / Like we did last year!
Come on, let's twist again / Twistin' time is heeeere!
