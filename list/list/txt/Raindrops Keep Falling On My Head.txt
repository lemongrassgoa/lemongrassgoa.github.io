Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head (orig. F)

C                           CM7
Raindrops are falling on my head
    C7                               FM7             Em7
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
A7               Em7
Nothing seems to fit
A7      Dm7
Those / raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

F/G           C                          CM7
    So I just did me some talking to the sun
    C7                       FM7               Em7
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
A7              Em7
Sleeping on the job
A7      Dm7
Those / raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

F/G                    C       CM7
    But there's one thing I know
   /F#  F                  G
    The blues they send to meet me
            Em7
    Won't defeat me, it won't be long
         A7              Dm7              F/G-G  F/G-G
    Till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
    Because I'm free / Nothing's worrying me
... It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
    Because I'm free / Nothing's worrying me
