Baby (orig Cm)

INTRO: | F#

| Bm
Standing here in an empty room
I saw you there and my blood ran cold
Take me back to that long September
Don't know how I ever let you go

I was young, didn't know 'bout love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Gave my heart to another lover
Don't know how I ever let you go

    | Bm - - - | F#7 - - - | Bm - - - | A - - - |
    | D  - - - | F#7 - - - | G  - - - | A - - - |
    Find me, another place and time
    If only, if only you were mine
    But I'm already someone else's baby

    | Em7 - - - | A7  - - - | DM7 - - - | GM7 - - - |
    | Em6 - - - | F#7 - - - | F#  - - - | F#  - - - |
    Guess I had my last chance
    And now this is our last dance
    You fell through the cracks in my hands
    Hard to say it's over
    But I'm already someone else's
    Baby, ahh | x3
    I'm already someone else's

| Bm
All caught up in the way we were
I feel your hands getting close to mine
Don't say the words that I love to hear
The beat goes on and I close my eyes

I was young, didn't know 'bout love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Let's leave things the way they were
You'll stay with me like a lullaby

    | Bm - - - | F#7 - - - | Bm  - - - | A - - - |
    | D  - - - | F#7 - - - | GM7 - - - | A - - - |
    Find me, in another place and time
    If only, if only you were mine
    But I'm already someone else's baby

    | Em7 - - - | A7  - - - | DM7 -   -  - | GM7 - - - |
    | Em6 - - - | F#7 - - - | Bm  - A/C# - |  D  - B7 - |
    Guess I had my last chance
    And now this is our last dance
    You fell through the cracks in my hands
    Tell myself be stronger
    My heart's like a rubber band

    | Em7 - - - | A7  - - - | DM7 - - - | GM7 - - - |
    | Em6 - - - | F#7 - - - | F#  - - - | F#  - - - |
    And it's such a shame
    You'll always be the one who got away
    We both know that deep down you feel the same
    Hard to say it's over
    But I'm already someone else's
    Baby, ahh | x3
    I'm already someone else's
    
    | Em7 - - - | A7  - - - | DM7 - - - | GM7 - - - |
    | Em6 - - - | F#7 - - - | F#  - - - | F#  - - - |
    Wish I met you at another place and time
    If only, if only you were mine
    This love story ends for you and I
    'Cause I'm already someone else's
    Baby, ahh | x3 
    I'm already someone else's
    Baby, ahh | x3
    I'm already someone else's
