Dusty Springfield
Son Of A Preacher Man

(RIFF)

[E] Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his [A] daddy would visit he'd [E] come along
When they'd gather 'round and started talking
[B7]
That's when Billy would take me walking
A-through the back yard we'd go walking
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my surprise
 
    The [E] only one who could ever reach me
    [A] Was the son of a [E] preacher man
    The [E] only boy who could ever teach me
    [A] Was the son of a [E] preacher man
    Yes he [E] was, he [B] was, [A] mmm, yes he was
 
(RIFF)
 
[E] Being good isn't always easy
[A] No matter how [E] hard I'd try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
[B7]
He'd come and tell me everything is all right
He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right
Can I get away again tonight
 
    The [E] only one who could ever reach me
    [A] Was the son of a [E] preacher man
    The [E] only boy who could ever teach me
    [A] Was the son of a [E] preacher man
    Yes, he [E] was, he [B] was, [A] ooh, Lord knows, he was (yes, he was)

(BRIDGE)
[D] How well I remember
[A] The look that was in his eyes
    Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
[B] Takin' time to make time
    Tellin' me that he's all mine
[E] Learnin' from each other's knowin'
    Lookin' to see how much we've grown and
 
    And the [E] only one who could ever reach me
    [A] Was the son of a [E] preacher man
    The [E] only boy who could ever teach me
    [A] Was the son of a [E] preacher man
    Yes he [E] was, he [B] was, [A] ooh, yes he was
 
 
    The [A] only one who could ever reach me
    [D] Was the son of a [A] preacher man
    The [A] only boy who could ever teach me
    [D] Was the son of a [A] preacher man
    Yes he [A] was, he [E] was, [D7] ooh, yes he was

    (The only boy who could ever reach me)
He was the sweet-talkin' son of a preacher man
    (The only boy who could ever teach me)
I kissed me the son of a preacher man
    (The only one who could ever move me)
The sweet-lovin' son of a preacher man
    (The only one who could ever groove me)
    (Was the son of a preacher man)
    (The only one who could ever reach me)
    (Was the son of a)
