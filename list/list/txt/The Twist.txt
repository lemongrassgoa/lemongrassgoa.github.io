Chubby Checker
The Twist

Come on, baby / Let's do the twist
Come on, baby / Let's do the twist
Take me by my little hand / And go like this

E-yah, twist / Baby, baby, twist ('Round and 'round and 'round)
Ooh yeah, just like this
Come on, little miss / And do the twist

My daddy is sleepin' / And mama ain't around
Yeah, daddy's just sleepin' / And mama ain't around
We're gonna a-twist, a-twist, a-twistin'
'Til we tear the house down

Come on and twist / Yeah, baby, twist  ('Round and 'round and 'round)
Ooh yeah, just like this
Come on, little miss / And do the twist
E-yah

(interlude)

Yeah, you should see my little sis
You should see my, my little sis
She really knows how to rock
She knows how to twist

Come on and twist / Yeah, baby, twist
Ooh yeah, just like this
Come on, little miss / And do the twist
Yeah
That's all right / Yeah
Twist all night
Twist
('Round and 'round and 'round)
