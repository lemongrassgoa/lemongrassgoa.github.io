Can't Smile Without You
Barry Manilow

[D]  You know I [G] can't smile without you
[Em] I can't smile without you
[Am] I can't laugh and I can't sing
[D]  I'm finding it hard to do anything
[G]  You see I feel sad when you're sad
[Em] I feel glad when you're glad
[Am] If you only knew what I'm going through
[D]  I just can't smile without [G] you

[G] You came along [Em] just like a song
And [Am] brightened my day [D] Who'd have believed that you were
[G] part of a dream [Em] Now it all seems [Am] light years away

[D]  And now you know I [G] can't smile without you
[Em] I can't smile without you
[Am] I can't laugh and I can't sing
[D]  I'm finding it hard to do any [Eb] thing

[G#]  You see I feel sad when you're sad
[Fm]  I feel glad when you're glad
[Bbm] If you only knew what I'm going through
[Eb]  I just can't smile

Now [Ebm7] some people say happiness takes
[G#s4] so very long to [C#M7] find
Well, I'm [C#m] finding it hard 
leaving your love be [Eb]-hind [E] me

[E]   And you see I [A] can't smile without you
[F#m] I can't smile without you
[Bm]  I can't laugh and I can't sing
[E]   I'm finding it hard to do any [F] thing

[Bb]  You see I feel sad when you're sad
[Gm]  I feel glad when you're glad
[Cm]  If you only knew what I'm going through
[F]   I just can't smile without [Bb] you
