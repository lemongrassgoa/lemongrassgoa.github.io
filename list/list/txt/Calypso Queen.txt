Calypso Rose
Calypso Queen

(intro riff)

    They say that I reign too long
    Forgetting that me constitution is strong
    Instead of respecting me long, long reign
    They making plot to take down me name

I've been breaking down walls
Ever since I was small
They could stand up tall and strong
Like a wrecking ball, I go knock them down

    They say that I reign too long
    Forgetting that me constitution is strong
    Instead of respecting me long, long reign
    They making plot to take down me name

Everywhere I reign supreme
The one and only Calypso Queen
No man alive or dead
Could come and take the crown of me head

(intro riff)

Them foolish and petty men
I don't worry 'bout them
They've been trying to take me down
But to the end I retain me crown

    They say that I reign too long
    Forgetting that me constitution is strong
    Instead of respecting me long, long reign
    They making plot to take down me name

They used to call me Small Island Girl
Now I travel the world
Anywhere they go they know
I am Calypso Rose, Queen of Calypso

(solo)

I am the daughter of the warrior
No time to rest or retire
Others have come and gone
But Calypso Rose is still singing on

    They say that I reign too long
    Forgetting that me constitution is strong
    Instead of respecting me long, long reign
    They making plot to take down me name

(intro riff)
