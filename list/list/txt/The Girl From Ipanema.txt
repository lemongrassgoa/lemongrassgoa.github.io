The Girl From Ipanema
Stan Getz / Joao Gilberto

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking 
And when she passes, each one she passes goes "ah"
	When she walks, she's like a samba
	That swings so cool and sways so gently that
	When she passes, each one she passes goes "ah"

Oh, but I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her?
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes, I smile but she doesn't see
