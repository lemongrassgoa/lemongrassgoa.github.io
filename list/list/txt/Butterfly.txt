Jason Mraz
Butterfly (orig Fm)

I'm taking a moment just imaginin' that I'm dancin' with you
I'm your pole and all you're wearing is your shoes
You got soul, you know what to do to turn me on until I write a song about you
And you have your own engaging style
And you've got the knack to vivify
And you make my slacks a little tight, you may unfasten them if you like
That's if you crash and spend the night
         
    But you don't fold, you don't fade
    You've got everything you need, especially me
    Sister you've got it all
    You make the call to make my day / In your message say my name
    Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all
         
Curl your upper lip up and let me look around
Ride your tongue along your bottom lip and bite down
And bend your back and ask those hips if I can touch
Because they're the perfect jumping off point of getting closer to your
         
    Butterfly / Well you float on by
    Oh kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
    Or Eskimo your nose real close to mine
    And let's mood the lights and finally make it right
    But you don't fold, you don't fade, you've got everything you need
    Especially me / Sister you've got it all
         
You make the call to make my day / In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk sister you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all [2x]

You've got it all, you've got it all
         
    Doll I need to see you pull your knee socks up
    Let me feel you up side down, slide in, slide out, slide over here
    Climb in my mouth now child
         
Butterfly, well you landed on my mind
Damn right you landed on my ear and then you crawled inside
Now I see you perfectly behind closed eyes
I wanna fly with you and I don't wanna lie to you
Cause I, cause I can't recall a better day
Sun coming to shine on the occasion
You're an open-minded lady / You've got it all
And I never forget a face / If I'm making my own I have my days
Let's face the facts here, it's you who's got it all

You know that fortune favors the brave
Well let me get paid while I make you breakfast
The rest is up to you, you make the call

You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all

Cause I can't recall a better day
Sun comin' to shine on the occasion
You're a sophisticated lady, oh you've got it all

You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all [3x]
You've got it all, you've got it all.

Butterfly, baby, well you've got it all



























































































































This refers to the acoustic version off the We Dance EP. And this is 
as close as I can get it. I put the chords I use at the end, so scroll 
down. Mraz likes to mix it up, so the strumming, for instance, changes throughout 
the song. Have fun.

Standard tuning
Capo on first fret
