VERSE 1: I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
         So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
|        D        D+     ...    G       A
         Look at me now, will I ever learn?
         I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
         There's a fire within my soul
|        G    D    A
         Just one  look and I can hear a bell ring
         One  more look and I forget everything, whoa-oh
         
|        D                         G  C  G
REFRAIN: Mamma mia, here I go again / My my, how can I resist you?
         Mamma mia, does it show again? / My my, just how much I've missed you
|        D              A/C#            Bm             F#m/A
         Yes, I've been brokenhearted / Blue since the day we parted
|        G  C  G   Em7        A
         Why, why  did I ever let you go?
|        D        Bm                 G  C  G   Em            A         D     D+
         Mamma mia, now I really know / why why, I could never let you go.
         
|        D      G
VERSE 2: I've been angry and sad about things that you do
         I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
|        D      D+     ...     G      A
         And when you go, when you slam the door
         I think you know that you won't be away too long
         You know that I'm not that strong
|        G    D    A
         Just one  look and I can hear a bell ring
         One  more look and I forget everything, whoa-oh
         
|        D                         G  C  G
REFRAIN: Mamma mia, here I go again / My my, how can I resist you?

         Yes, I've been brokenhearted / Blue since the day we parted
|        G  C    G   Em         A
         Why, why did I ever let you go?
|        D                       G  C   G
         Mamma mia, even if I say / Bye bye, leave me now or never
         Mamma mia, it's a game we play / Bye bye doesn't mean forever
         Mamma mia, here I go again / My my, how can I resist you?
         Mamma mia, does it show again? / My my, just how much I've missed you

         Mamma mia, now I really know / why why, I could never let you go.
