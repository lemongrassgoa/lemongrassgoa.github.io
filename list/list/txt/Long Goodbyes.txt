Long Goodbyes
Kurt Hunter

         D   Bm7   Em7   A7s4
VERSE 1: Whenever we get together to spend time
         we never need a plan
         The car radio makes the parking lot
         the perfect place to dance

         G                       A 
LINK 1:  When time is fun it flies too fast but 
         we found a way to make it last

           D   Bm7   Em7   A7s4
REFRAIN 1: By saying those long goodbyes
           they make the night a little longer
           and it ain't no big surprise
           how quickly time begins to wander away
           in your [BbM7]eyes / in the [A]middle of long goodbyes

         D   Bm7   Em7   A7s4
VERSE 2: We laugh and we joke on the phone all day
         and sometimes late at night
         and though we're miles apart
		 we share the same cellular light

         G                          A
LINK 2:  it's time for bed but even so
         you know it's hard to let you go, before

           D   Bm7   Em7   A7s4
REFRAIN 2: Saying those long goodbyes
           To make the night a little longer
           Even if we both try / to check the minutes that we
           squander away [BbM7]rely / on another long good bye

         G                       E7/G#
BRIDGE:  Darling if you feel the same
                      D  /D   /C# /C   E7/B
		 then there's no need to  ex - plain
         BbM7              A7s4
         why we postpone / being alone ... and stay ...

         G                                A
LINK 3:  And when we've said our last goodnight
         you know we'll want to say it one more time
