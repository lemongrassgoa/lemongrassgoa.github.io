She Said
Plan B (orig. Ebm)

| Em              B7
She said "I love you boy, I love you so"
She said "I love you baby, oh oh oh oh"
She said "I love you more than words can say"
She said "I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-by"

[Em] So I said, "What you're saying girl it can't be right
[B7] How can you be in love with me
     We only just met tonight"
[Em] So she said, "Boy I loved you from the start
[B7] When I first heard love goes down
     Something started burning in my heart"
[G]  I said, "Stop this crazy [B7] talk
[G]  And leave right now and close the [B7] door"

| Em              B7
She said "I love you boy I love you so"
She said "I love you baby oh oh oh oh"
She said "I love you more than words can say"
She said "I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-by"

So, now I'm up in the courts
Pleading my case from the witness box
Telling the judge and jury the same thing that I said to the cops
    On the day that I got arrested
    I'm innocent I protested
    She just feels rejected
    Had her heart broken by someone she's obsessed with
'Cause she likes the sound of my music
Which makes her a fan of my music
That's why love goes down not to lose it
'Cause she can't separate the man from the music
    And I'm saying all this in the stand
    While my girl cries tears in the galleries
    Got bigger than I ever could have planned
    Like that song by the Zutons, "Valerie"
So the jury don't look like they're buying it
And it's making me nervous
Arms crossed, screw faced like I'm trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like I'm murderous
    They wanna lock me up
    And throw away the key
    They wanna send me down
    Even though I told them she...

She said "I love you boy, I love you so"
She said "I love you baby, oh oh oh oh"

She said "I love you more than words can say"
She said "I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-by"

So I said, "Why the hell you gotta treat me this way?
You don't know what love is
You wouldn't do this if you did
Oh no no no no"
