If 
Bread (Capo 3)

| D   D/C#   D/C   G/B   /   Gm/Bb   D/A   Gm6   A7
If a picture paints a thousand words
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show
The you I've come to know
If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you
You're all that's left me too

|   Bm      Bm/Bb    Bm/A            G6
And when my love for life is running dry
|   F#m7     B7       Em7     A7
You come and pour yourself on me

| D   D/C#   D/C   G/B   Gm/Bb   D/A   Gm6   A7
If a man could be two places at one time
I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way
If the world should stop revolving
Spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you
And when the world was through

|    Bm     Bm/Bb   Bm/A               G6
Then one by one the stars would all go out
|    F#m7    B7      Em7    A7s  D    G   Gm    D
Then you and I would simply fly away
