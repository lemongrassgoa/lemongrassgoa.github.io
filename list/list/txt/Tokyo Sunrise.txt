LP
Tokyo Sunrise

Said a lot of words along the way
I meant them all while we reigned
But shores of love get beaten by the waves
and after it was done I wish I'd saved time

One less spark from the flame
One more heart beat away
I think I lost your scent after the rain
I'll find you when our paths cross by the gold mines

Ooooh ooooh oooooh

Where you gonna go, where you gonna go
I can tell you that
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah
Some day in the sky we'll see the same sun on the rise yeah
Wherever you go, far as Tokyo, I can say
I'll see you again / I'll see you again / I'll see you again
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhhh oh

Aching with a debt never paid
Horses broken and splayed
Breathing half a breath since you're away
But while your blood is warm I'll keep the home fires

Chorus

My love is never gone away
It's gonna come around someday
My love is never gone away
It's gonna come around someday
I'll see you again
I'll see you again
