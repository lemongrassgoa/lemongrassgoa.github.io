Umbrella (orig F#) [drum: Groove Beat 1, bpm: 90]

| Gs2     D       F#7       Bm7
You have my heart / And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines / But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark / You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there / With you I'll always share
Because

    | Gs2     D       A       Bm7
    When the sun shines, we'll shine together
    Told you I'd be here forever
    Said I'll always be a friend
    Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
    Now that it's raining more than ever
    Know that we'll still have each other
    You can stand under my umbrella
    You can stand [ under my umbrella (ella, ella, ey, ey, ey) ]

| Gs2     D       F#7       Bm7
These fancy things, will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart
Because

    | Gs2     D       A       Bm7
    When the sun shines, we'll shine together
    Told you I'd be here forever
    Said I'll always be a friend
    Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
    Now that it's raining more than ever
    Know that we'll still have each other
    You can stand under my umbrella
    You can stand [ under my umbrella (ella, ella, ey, ey, ey) ]

| C                         G/B
  You can run into my arms / It's OK, don't be alarmed
|    D                                     A
Come here to me / There's no distance in between our love
| C                         G/B                             F#7(s4)
So go on and let the rain pour / I'll be all you need and more
Because

    | Gs2     D       F#m       Bm7
    When the sun shines, we'll shine together
    Told you I'd be here forever
    Said I'll always be a friend
    Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
    Now that it's raining more than ever
    Know that we'll still have each other
    You can stand under my umbrella
    You can stand [ under my umbrella (ella, ella, ey, ey, ey) ]
