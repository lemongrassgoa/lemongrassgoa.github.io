Jim Croce
I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song

Well, I know it's kind of late
I hope I didn't wake you
But what I gotta say can't wait
I know you'd understand

    'Cause ev'ry time I tried to tell you
    The words just came out wrong
    So I'll have to say I love you in a song

Yeah, I know it's kind of strange
But ev'ry time I'm near you
I just run out of things to say
I know you'd understand

    'Cause ev'ry time I tried to tell you
    The words just came out wrong
    So I'll have to say I love you in a song

    'Cause ev'ry time the time was right
    All the words just came out wrong
    So I'll have to say I love you in a song

Yeah, I know it's kind of late
I hope I didn't wake you
But there's something that I just gotta say
I know you'd understand

    'Cause ev'ry time I tried to tell you
    The words just came out wrong
    So I'll have to say I love you in a song
