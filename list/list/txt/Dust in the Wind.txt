Dust In The Wind

I close my    eyes / only for a moment and the moment's gone
All my    dreams / pass before my eyes a curiosity

Dust in the wind    /  all we are is dust in the wind

Same old   song / just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we   do / crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see

Dust in the wind    /  all we are is dust in the wind  ...  ohhh

(INSTRUMENTAL)

Now, don't hang  on / nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips a  -  way / and all your money won´t another minute buy

Dust in the wind / all we are is dust in the wind
Dust in the wind / everything is dust in the wind.
