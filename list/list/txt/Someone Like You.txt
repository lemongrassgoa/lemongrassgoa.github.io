Someone Like You
Adele

A   C#m/G#   F#m   D

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl, and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
It ain't like you to hold back, or hide from life

      Eadd9         F#m7          D         (Eadd9/D)
    I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
    Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
    I'd hoped you'd see my face
    And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

    A         E/G#         F#m        D
    Never mind, I'll find someone like you
    I wish nothing but the best for you too
    Don't forget me, I beg / I remember you said
    Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

  Eadd9         F#m7          D         (Eadd9/D)
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

A         E/G#         F#m        D
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg / I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
(Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah)

                 
[E/B]    Nothing compares no worries or cares
[F#m/C#] Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
[D]      Who would have known how
       Bm    A/C#        D
Bitter-sweet this would taste

A         E/G#         F#m        D
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg / I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg / I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
(Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah)
