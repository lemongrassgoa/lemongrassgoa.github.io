Cliff Richard
Summer Holiday (orig. E)

E       C#m     F#m     B
We're all goin' on a summer holiday
No more workin' for a week or two
Fun and laughter on our summer holiday
F#m       B         E     C#m
No more worries for me or you
F#m    B       E
For a week or two

          F#m             B          E       C#m
    We're goin' where the sun shines brightly
          F#m             B      E
    We're goin' where the sea is blue
    G#m
    We've seen it in the movies
    F#7               B
    Let's see if it's true

E       C#m     F#m     B
Everybody has a summer holiday
Doin' things they always wanted to
So we're goin' on a summer holiday
F#m       B         E     C#m
To make our dreams come true
F#m    B       E
For me and you

(interlude, instrumental verse)

          F#m             B          E       C#m
    We're goin' where the sun shines brightly
          F#m             B      E
    We're goin' where the sea is blue
    G#m
    We've seen it in the movies
    F#7               B
    Let's see if it's true [C7]

F       Dm      Gm      C
Everybody has a summer holiday
Doin' things they always wanted to
So we're goin' on a summer holiday
Gm      C       F       Dm
To make our dreams come true
For me and you / Hmmmm
