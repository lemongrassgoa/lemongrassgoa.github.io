VERSE 1: What do you see that's so beauti-ful
                 D        G              Asus4   F#m7
         That it always reflects in your eyes
             Bm             Em       F#m              G

VERSE 2: When I used to see you I'd smile
                D           G       Asus4   F#m7
         Just a pretty girl up on a sign
                  Bm            Em             F#m
         Then I'd thank God for mine now she's leaving
             G         D        Asus4        D      G
         And I need an angel to keep me from crying
