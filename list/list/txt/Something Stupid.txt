Frank Sinatra
Something Stupid (orig. E)

INTRO: | F#m      B       F#m     B       E

| [ EM7         E6 ]
I know I stand in line
until you think you have the time
| [ F#m          B ]
To spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance
| [ EM7         E6 ]
You won't be leaving with me

| E7
And afterwards, we drop
into a quiet little place
|          A               C7
And have a drink or two
    | [ F#m          B ]
    And then I go and spoil it all
    by saying something stupid
    |      [ EM7         E6 ]
    Like I love you

| E7
I can see it in your eyes
that you despise the same old lies
|             AM7
You heard the night before
| F#7
And though it's just a line to you
for me it's true
|                  B7            B+
It never seemed so right before

| [ EM7         E6 ]
I practice everyday to find
some clever lines to say
| [ F#m          B ]
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait
until the evening gets late
| [ EM7         E6 ]
And I'm alone with you

| E7
The time is right, your perfume
fills my head, the stars get red
|          A               C7
And oh the night's so blue
    | [ F#m          B ]
    And then I go and spoil it all
    by saying something stupid
    |      [ EM7         E6 ]
    Like I love you

(instrumental)

| E7
The time is right, your perfume
fills my head, the stars get red
|          A               C
And oh the night's so blue
    | [ F#m          B ]
    And then I go and spoil it all
    by saying something stupid
    |      [ EM7         E6 ]       C7
    Like I love you
    | E6        C7
    I love you, I love you, I love you
    I love you
