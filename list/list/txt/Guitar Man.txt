The Guitar Man
Bread

Who draws the crowd and plays so loud, baby, it's the guitar man 
Who's gonna steal the show, you know, baby, it's the guitar man 
| Em   C    Em   A7
He can make you love, he can make you cry 
He will bring you down and he'll get you high
| C    Bm   Am   D
Somethin' keeps him goin' miles and miles a day 
To find another place to play

Night after night, who treats you right, baby, it's the guitar man 
Who's on the radio, you go and listen to the guitar man 
| Em   C    Em   A7
Then he comes to town and you see his face 
And you think you might like to take his place 
| C    Bm   Am   D
Somethin' keeps him driftin' miles and miles away 
Searching for the songs to play

| Am    G#+     C/G    D/F#
Then you listen to the music and you like to sing along 
| G     Bm/F#   Em     E
You want to get the meaning out of each and every song 
| Am    G#+     C/G    D
Then you find yourself a message         |   E      C   D
and some words to call your own and take 'em home

| Em   C    Em   A7
He can make you love, he can get you high 
He will bring you down, then he'll make, make you cry 
| C    Bm   Am   D
Somethin' keeps him movin', but no one seems to know 
What it is that makes him go 

| Am    G#+     C/G    D/F#
Then the lights begin to flicker and the sound is getting dim 
| G     Bm/F#   Em     E
The voice begins to falter and the crowds are getting thin 
| Am    G#+     C/G    D                                             E     C
But he never seems to notice, he's just got to find another place to play
