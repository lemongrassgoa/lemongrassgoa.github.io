I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips
A thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello! / Is it me you're looking [A] for?

| Dm  -  G  -  | C  -  F  -  |
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
| Bb  -  E+  E  | Am  E7/B  Am/C  E7/B  |
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide
| Dm  -  G  -  | C  -  F  -  |
'cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
| Bb  -  E+  E  ...
And I want to tell you so much / I love you

| Am - Am/G - | Am/F - Am/G  Am/F |
I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello! / I've just got to let you [A] know

| Dm  -  G  -  | C  -  F  -  |
'cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
| Bb  -  E+  E  | Am  E7/B  Am/C  E7/B  |
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
| Dm  -  G  -  | C  -  F  -  |
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
| Bb  -  E+  E  ...
But let me start by saying / I love you
