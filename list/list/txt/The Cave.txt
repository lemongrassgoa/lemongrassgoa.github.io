Mumford And Sons
The Cave Capo 4

(INTRO) (fingerpicking)
Am   C   Am    C    Am    C  G    C    F  C

(VERSE 1)
Am    C  
It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

(REFRAIN)
    C      F       C          C       F       C
But I will hold on hope / And I won't let you choke
F            C           G
On the noose around your neck
    Am        F           C          Am     F         C
And I'll find strength in pain / And I will change my ways
F            C                   G
I'll know my name as it's called again     (intro theme)

(VERSE 2)
Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

(REFRAIN)   

(VERSE 4/BRIDGE)
So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's hand

   C         F       C          C    F       C  
So make your siren's call / And sing all you want
  F        C             G
I will not hear what you have to say
      Am     F       C         Am     F       C  
Cause I need freedom now / And I need to know how
   F       C            G 
To live my life as it's meant to be        (intro theme) x2

(REFRAIN)  (end on C)
