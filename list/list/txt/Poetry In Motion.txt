Poetry In Motion (orig G#)

G    Am7    Bm    C         D
When I see my baby / What do I see
Poetry / Poetry in motion

G    Em     Am     D
Poetry in motion / Walkin' by my side
Her lovely locomotion / Keeps my eyes open wide
Poetry in motion / See her gentle sway
A wave out on the ocean / Could [Am] never [D7] move that [G] way

B7    Em    B7    Em    []   B7   C    Am   D
I love every movement / And there's nothing I would change
She doesn't need improvement / She's much too nice to rearrange

G    Em     Am     D
Poetry in motion / Dancing close to me
A flower of devotion / A-swaying gracefully
                         Am      D7      G
G    Em     Am     D
whoa ...

G    Em     Am     D
Poetry in motion / See her gentle sway
A wave out on the ocean / Could [Am] never [D7] move that [G] way

B7    Em    B7    Em    []   B7   C    Am   D
I love every movement / There's nothing I would change
She doesn't need improvement / She's much too nice to rearrange

G    Em     Am     D
Poetry in motion / All that I adore
No number-nine love potion / Could make me love her more
                                   Am      D7       G

G    Em     Am     D
whoa ...
