The Steve Miller Band
The Joker (in F)  [rhythm: 16th Shuffle 1, bpm: 85]

Some people call me the space cowboy / some call me the gangster of love
Some people call me Maurice / Cause I speak of the pompitous of love
People talk about me, baby / Say I'm doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong
Well, don't you worry baby, don't worry
'Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home

(REFRAIN)
Cause I'm a picker / I'm a grinner / I'm a lover / And I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker / I'm a smoker / I'm a midnight toker
(I get my lovin' on the run)
Wooo Woohoo

(interlude)

You're the cutest thing / That I ever did see
I really love your peaches / Want to shake your tree
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
Ooo-eee baby, I'll sure show you a good time

(REFRAIN)
......
(I sure don't want to hurt no one)
Wooo Woohoo

(interlude)

People keep talking about me baby / They say I'm doin' you wrong
Well don't you worry, don't worry, no don't worry mama
'Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home

You're the cutest thing I ever did see
Really love your peaches want to shake your tree
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
Come on baby and I'll show you a good time
