(VERSE 1)
| D                          F#m
Hey there Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
|     D                               F#m                               Bm(/A)   G
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl tonight you look so pretty, yes you do
|                  A                  Bm                 A
Times Square can't shine as bright as you / I swear it's true
| D                          F#m
Hey there Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
|         D                                  F#m                             Bm(/A)   G
I'm right there if you get lonely, Give this song another listen, close your eyes
|            A                Bm                    A
Listen to my voice, that's my disguise, I'm by your side.

Oh it's what you do to me   /   Oh it's what you do to me   |   x2
|              D
What you do to me. 

(VERSE 2)
| D                       F#m
Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard
|          D                                    F#m                                   Bm(/A)   G
But just believe me girl some day, I'll pay the bills with this guitar, we'll have it good
|              A               Bm                A
We'll have the life we knew we would, my word is good. 
| D                         F#m   
Hey there Delilah, I've got so much left to say, 
|        D                                F#m                                 Bm(/A)   G
If every simple song I wrote to you Would take your breath away, I'd write it all
|            A                  Bm                 A
Even more in love with me you'd fall, we'd have it all.

(BRIDGE)
| G                                    A
A thousand miles seems pretty far, But they've got planes and trains and cars
| D                      D/A      Bm
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
| G                                       A
Our friends would all make fun of us, and we'll just laugh along because
|  D                           D/C#      Bm
We know that none of them have felt this way
| G                            A
Delilah I can promise you that by the time that we get through
|   Bm                                               A
The world will never ever be the same, and you're to blame. 

(VERSE 3)
| D                      F#m
Hey there Delilah you be good and don't you miss me
|        D                                         F#m                           Bm(/A)   G
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history like I do
|                A              Bm   G              A            Bm
You'll know it's all because of you / we can do whatever we want to
| G         A               Bm                  A
Hey there Delilah here's to you, this one's for you.
