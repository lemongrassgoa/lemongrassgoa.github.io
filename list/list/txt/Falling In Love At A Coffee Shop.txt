Falling In Love At A Coffee Shop (Capo 2)

D
I think that possibly, maybe I'm falling for you
D
Yes there's a chance that I've fallen quite hard over you.
G
I've seen the paths that your eyes wander down / I want to come too
D                       A                     D
I think that possibly / maybe I'm falling for you

No one understands me quite like you do / Through all of the shadowy corners of me

Yes there's a chance that I've fallen quite hard over you.
G
I've seen the waters that make your eyes shine / Now I'm shining too
D                          A                      D
Because, oh because / I've fallen quite hard over you
