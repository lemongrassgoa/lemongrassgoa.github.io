INTRO: |   C     Em

| C     Em
I never thought that you would be 
the one to hold my heart
But you came around and you knocked me 
off the ground from the start
| F            G           F/A
  You put your arms around me
|       G/B             C                 G/B    F/A
and I believe that it's easier for you to let me go
| G     F              G                C
    You put your arms around me and I'm home

| C      Em
How many times will you let me 
change my mind and turn around?
I can't decide if I'll let you 
save my life or if I'll drown

|   Am              G         C          F
    I hope that you see right through my walls
    I hope that you catch me 'cause I'm already falling
|   Am         G     C           F
    I'll never let a love get so close
|       F              G                C
    You put your arms around me and I'm home  (intro x2)

| C     Em
The world is coming down on me and
I can't find a reason to be loved
I never wanna leave you but 
I can't make you bleed if I'm alone
| F            G           F/A
  You put your arms around me
|       G/B             C                 G/B    F/A
and I believe that it's easier for you to let me go

|   Am              G         C          F
    I hope that you see right through my walls
    I hope that you catch me 'cause I'm already falling
|   Am         G     C           F
    I'll never let a love get so close
|       F              G
    You put your arms around me 
|                 Am       G     Em      F
    ...   and I'm home

| Am               G             Em            F
I tried my best to never let you in to see the truth
And I've never opened up / I've never truly loved 'til
| F            G           F/A
  You put your arms around me
|       G/B             C                 G/B    F/A
and I believe that it's easier for you to let me go

| C   %   Em   %   C   %   Em  G

|   Am              G         C          F
    I hope that you see right through my walls
    I hope that you catch me 'cause I'm already falling
|   Am         G     C           F
    I'll never let a love get so close
|       F              G                C
    You put your arms around me and I'm home

|   F              G                C
You put your arms around me and I'm home
