Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)

[Intro]
 
Em Am B B7 Em
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
       Em
I was five and he was six
    Em
We rode on horses made of sticks
Am
He wore black and I wore white
B                B7
He would always win the fight
 
 
[Refrain]
 
      Em
Bang bang, he shot me down
      Em
Bang bang, I hit the ground
      Am
Bang bang, that awful sound
      B        B7           Em  Am B B7 Em
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
         Em
Seasons came and changed the time
     Em
When I grew up I called him mine
Am
He would always laugh and say
   B             B7
Remember when we used to play
 
 
[Refrain]
 
      Em
Bang bang, I shot you down
      Em
Bang bang, you hit the ground
      Am
Bang bang, that awful sound
      B      B7                 Em  Am B B7
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Em
  Music played and people sang
D                                  Am B B7 Em
  Just for me the church bells rang
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
          Em
Now he's gone, I don't know why
     Em
And till this day, sometimes I cry
    Am
He didn't even say goodbye
    B               B7
He didn't take the time to lie
 
 
[Refrain]
 
      Em
Bang bang, he shot me down
      Em
Bang bang, I hit the ground
      Am
Bang bang, that awful sound
      B        B7           Em  Am B B7 Em
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
