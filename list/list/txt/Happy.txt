| E7     ...     E7  -  A9  -  B9  -  A9
It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way

          | CM7     Bm7     Bm7     E
Because I'm happy
    Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
    Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
    Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
    Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

| E7     ...     E7  -  A9  -  B9  -  A9
Here come bad news talking this and that, yeah,
Well, give me all you got, and don't hold it back, yeah,
Well, I should probably warn you I'll be just fine, yeah,
No offense to you, don't waste your time
Here's why

          | CM7     Bm7     Bm7     E
Because I'm happy
    Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
    Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
    Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
    Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

Bring me down / Can't nothing
Bring me down / My level's too high
Bring me down / Can't nothing
Bring me down / I said (let me tell you now)
Bring me down / Can't nothing
Bring me down / My level's too high
Bring me down / Can't nothing
Bring me down / I said
