Jerry Lee Lewis
Great Balls Of Fire ( C)

You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, but what a thrill
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny
You came along and you moved me honey
I've changed my mind, this love is fine
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

    Kiss me, baby, ooh, feels good
    Hold me, baby
    Well, I'll still love you like a lover should
    You're fine, so kind
    Got to tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I chew my nails and then I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous, but it sure is fun
Come on, baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

(interlude)

    Well kiss me, baby, ooh, feels good
    Hold me, baby
    Well, I'll still love you like a lover should
    You're fine, so kind
    Got to tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
Real nervous, but it sure is fun
Come on, baby, drive me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

Come on, baby, drive me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire
