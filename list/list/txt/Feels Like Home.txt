Feels Like Home (orig. D#)

| D       A/C#    D                    A
Somethin' in your eyes, makes me wanna lose myself
|              G                    D      A
Makes me wanna lose myself, in your arms
| D     A/C#              D               A
There's somethin' in your voice, makes my heart beat fast
|         G                             D      A
Hope this feeling lasts, the rest of my life

|      F#m      G         D     A/C#  Bm    A
If you knew how lonely my life  has   been
|       G         D       A
And how long I've been so alone
|      F#m      G     D                 A/C#   Bm  A
And if you knew how I wanted someone to come   a - long
|   G         D                   A
And change my life the way you've done

|             Ds4     D                 A
It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
|                 G       D/F#   Bm    E7           As4-A7
It feels like I'm all the way  back  where I come from
|             Ds4     D                 A
It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
|                 G       D/F#   E7   A       D(s4)
It feels like I'm all the way    back where I belong

| G       D/F#   E7   A       D(s4)

| D     A/C#   D              A
A win - dow    breaks, down a long, dark street
|     G                  D      A
And a siren wails in the night
|   D   A/C#   D                        A
But I'm al  -  right, 'cause I have you here with me
|         G                                     D      A
And I can almost see, through the dark there is light

|          F#m      G                D     A/C#  Bm    A
And if you knew how much this moment means to    me
|       G         D               A(7)
And how long I've waited for your touch
|          F#m      G             D    A/C#  Bm    A
And if you knew how happy you are ma - king  me
|       G                D         A(7)
I never thought I'd love anyone so much

|             Ds4     D                 A
It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
|                 G       D/F#   Bm    E7           A(7)
It feels like I'm all the way  back  where I come from
|             Ds4     D                 A
It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
|                 G       D/F#   E7   A       D(s4)
It feels like I'm all the way    back where I belong
It feels like I'm all the way    back where I belong
