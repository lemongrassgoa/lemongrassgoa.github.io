Nickel Creek (Bob Dylan)
Tomorrow is a Long Time Capo 3

(VERSE 1)
   G                C       G
If today was not an endless highway
   G                 C       G
If tonight was not a crooked trail
   C        D             G	
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
     C                   D                G
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all

(REFRAIN)
         C          D                 G
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
   C                D            G
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
         C       D             G
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
        C         D         G
Would I lie in my bed once again

(VERSE 2)
        G                 C      G
I can't see my reflection in the waters
        G                     C       G
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain
        C        D          G
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
   C            D               G
Or remember the sound of my own name


(REFRAIN)


(VERSE 3)
        G                     C       G
There's beauty in that silver singing river
        G                      C      G
There's beauty in that sunrise in the sky
            C                 D                  G
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
     C          D                 G
That I remember in my true love's eyes


(REFRAIN)
