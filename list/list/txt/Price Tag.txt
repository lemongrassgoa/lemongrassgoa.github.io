Jessie J
Price Tag (sing in C) [rhythm: Groove 1, bpm: 90]

Seems like everybody's got a price,
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second.
Just stop for a minute and smile

Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious?
Got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good time

    [Pre-chorus:]
    Everybody look to their left (yeah)
    Everybody look to their right
    Can you feel that (yeah)
    We're paying with love tonight?

    [Chorus:]
    It's not about the money, money, money
    We don't need your money, money, money
    We just wanna make the world dance,
    Forget about the price tag
    Ain't about the (uh) ch-ch-ching ch-ching
    Ain't about the (yeah) bl-bling-bl-bling
    Wanna make the world dance,
    Forget about the price tag (OK)

We need to take it back in time,
When music made us all unite!
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes,
Am I the only one getting tired?

Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guarantee we'll be feeling alright

    [Pre-chorus:]
    Everybody look to their left (to their left)
    Everybody look to their right (to their right)
    Can you feel that (yeah)
    We're paying with love tonight?

    [Chorus:]
    It's not about the money, money, money
    We don't need your money, money, money
    We just wanna make the world dance,
    Forget about the price tag
    Ain't about the (uh) ch-ching ch-ching
    Ain't about the (yeah) bl-bling-bl-bling
    Wanna make the world dance,
    Forget about the price tag

[Chorus 2x]

[Jessie J â€’ Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh
Forget about the price tag, yeah
