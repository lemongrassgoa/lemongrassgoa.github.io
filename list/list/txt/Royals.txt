Lorde
Royals (orig D)

E  ....
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address - in the torn up town
No postcode envy

                       E
But every song's like: gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ballgowns, trashin' the hotel room
D                             A
We don't care - we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
                     E
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
D                         A
We don't care - we aren't caught up in your love affair
 
    And we'll never be [E] royals (royals) - It don't run in our blood
    That kind of [D] looks just ain't for us
    We crave a [A] different kind of buzz
    Let me be your [E] ruler (ruler) - you can call me Queen Bee
    And baby I'll [D] rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
    [A] Let me live that fantasy
                              E
 
E  ....
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money
 
                       E
But every song's like: gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ballgowns, trashin' the hotel room
D                             A
We don't care - we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
                     E
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
D                         A
We don't care - we aren't caught up in your love affair
 
    And we'll never be [E] royals (royals) - It don't run in our blood
    That kind of [D] looks just ain't for us
    We crave a [A] different kind of buzz
    Let me be your [E] ruler (ruler) - you can call me Queen Bee
    And baby I'll [D] rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
    [A] Let me live that fantasy
                              E
 
(BRIDGE)
[E] oh ooh oh ohh
[D] We're bigger than we ever dreamed
[A] And I'm in love with being queen
[E] oh ooh oh ohh
[D] Life's a game without a care
    We aren't [A] caught up in your love affair
 
    And we'll never be [E] royals (royals) - It don't run in our blood
    That kind of [D] looks just ain't for us
    We crave a [A] different kind of buzz
    Let me be your [E] ruler (ruler) - you can call me Queen Bee
    And baby I'll [D] rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
    [A] Let me live that fantasy
