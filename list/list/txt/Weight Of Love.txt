Weight Of Love

INTRO: Em   A7  /  Em   G   D   C

Am   G    D   C
I used to think, darlin', you never did nothin'
But you were always up to somethin'
Always had a run in, yeah
I got to think those days are comin' to get ya
Now no body want to protect yah
They only want to forget yah

    Em    D   A7     G  D
    You'll be on my mind
    Don't give yourself away
    To the weight of love
    Em    D   C    B7
    You'll be on your side
    Don't give yourself away
    The weight of, weight of love

Am   G    D   C
Dance all night cause people, they don't wanna be lonely
Never wanna be lonely
They don't wanna be an only - one
You had a thing no one could ever be sure of
Never ever had a pure love
And never no cure from

[Chorus]

OUTRO: Em   D   C   G
