Eric Clapton
Autumn Leaves
(Simi Em)

INTRO:  Bm

         Em7   A7   DM7   GM7  /  C#-   F#7   Bm   %
VERSE 1: The falling leaves    Drift by my window
         The falling leaves    Of red and gold
         I see your lips    The summer kisses
         The sunburned hands    I used to hold

         C#-   F#7   Bm   %  /  Em7   A7   DM7
REFRAIN: Since you went away   The days grow long
         And soon I'll hear    Old winter's song 
         C#-   F#7   Bm   %  /  C#-   F#7   Bm   %
         But I miss you  Most of all   My darling
         When autumn leaves    Start to fall
