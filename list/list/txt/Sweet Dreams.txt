Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)

| Em            CM7       B7
Sweet dreams are made of this / Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

    Some of them want to use you
    Some of them want to get used by you
    Some of them want to abuse you
    Some of them want to be abused
