Glen Campbell (Jimmy Webb)
Wichita Lineman

I am a lineman for the county and I drive the main road
Searching in the sun for another overload
I hear you singing in the wire, I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation but it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain

And I need you more than want you, and I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line
And I need you more than want you, and I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line
