Jim Croce
Photographs And Memories

Photographs and memories / Christmas cards you sent to me
All that I have are these to remember you
Memories that come at night / Take me to another time
Back to a happier day, when I called you mine

But we sure had a good time / When we started way back when
Morning walks and bedroom talks / Oh, how I loved you then

Summer skies and lullabies / Nights we couldn't say goodbye
And of all of the things that we knew / Not a dream survived

(instrumental)

Photographs and memories / All the love you gave to me
Somehow it just can't be true / It's all I've left of you

But we sure had a good time / When we started way back when
Morning walks and bedroom talks / Oh, how I loved you then
