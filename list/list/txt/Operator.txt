    Operator oh could you help me place this call
Am                        D7/F#                    Em   D5/C D5/B D5/A
'See the number on the matchbook is old and faded
G                    Bm         C    B   Am G     C  G
She's living in L.A. with my best old ex-friend Ray
Am                 D7/F#                      Em    D5/C D5/B D5/A
A guy she said she knew well and sometimes hated
 
    G                 C/G               G
    Isn't that the way they say it goes
                 C       D
    But let's forget all that
        G                     Am
    And give me the number if you can find it
       C D   Em           Bm           D            Am
    So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine and to show
    D7                      C
    I've overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well
    G/B                  Am                          C
    I only wish my words could just convince myself
                           D        C
    That it just wasn't real, but that's not the way it feels

Cause I can't read the number that you just gave me
G                       Bm                C Bm    Am     G C G
There's something in my eyes, you know it happens every time
Am                D7                            Em     D5 D5/C D5/B D5/A
I think about the love that I thought would save me
 
    G                  C/G           G
    Isn't that the way they say it goes

     C         G  C
    No no no no   That's not the way it feels

Am                   D7/F#                 Em     D5  D5/C D5/B D5/A
There's no one there I really wanted to talk to
