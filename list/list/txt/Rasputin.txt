[Verse]
      Bm
There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
            Em                     F#             Bm
    (He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow)
     Bm
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
            Em                   F#            Bm
    (But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear)

Bm
He could preach the bible like a preacher
Em                  F#
Full of ecstasy and fire
Bm
But he also was the kind of teacher
Em     F#   Bm
Women would desire
 
    B     D         E            B
    Ra Ra Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen
    A           E        B
    There was a cat that really was gone
    (B)   D         E                 B
    Ra Ra Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
    A        E         B
    It was a shame how he carried on

[Verse]
   Bm
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Tsar
            Em                   F#           Bm
    But the kasatschok he danced really wunderbar
   Bm
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
           Em                     F#            Bm
    But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze

Bm
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Em                                 F#
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
Bm
She believed he was a holy healer
Em        F#       Bm
Who would heal her son
 
    B     D         E            B
    Ra Ra Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen
    A           E        B
    There was a cat that really was gone
    B     D         E                 B
    Ra Ra Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
    A        E         B
    It was a shame how he carried on
 
[Interlude] (Spoken)
 
| Bm - - - | A - - - | G - F#m - | Bm - - - | x2
"But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power
became known to more and more people, the demands to do
something about this outrageous man became louder and louder".
 
| Bm  -  -  -  |   Bm  -  F#  -  |
  Hey hey hey hey  hey hey hey hey (x4)

[Verse]
      Bm
"This man's just got to go," declared his enemies
            Em                        F#            Bm
    But the ladies begged, "Don't you try to do it, please"
   Bm
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
            Em                    F#            Bm
    Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms

Bm
Then one night some men of high standing
Em                          F#
Set a trap - they're not to blame
Bm
"Come to visit us," they kept demanding
Em     F#     Bm
And he really came
 
    B     D         E            B
    Ra Ra Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen
    A             E      B
    They put some poison into his wine
    B     D         E                 B
    Ra Ra Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
    A           E       B
    He drank it all and said "I feel fine"
 
B     D         E            B
Ra Ra Rasputin, lover of the Russian queen
A           E          B
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
B     D         E                 B
Ra Ra Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
A           E        B                (end on Bm)
And so they shot him till he was dead ...

(Spoken) Oh, those Russians...
