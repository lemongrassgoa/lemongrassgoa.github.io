Baby One More Time
Britney Spears (orig Cm) [rhythm: Simple 1, bpm: 100]

| Bm - - - | F# - - - | D - - - | Em - F# - |
Oh, baby, baby / How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby / I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

    Show me how you want it to be
    Tell me, baby / 'Cause I need to know now, oh, because...

    | Bm - - - | F# - - - | D - - - | Em - F# - |
    My loneliness / Is killing me (and I)
    I must confess / I still believe (still believe)
    When I'm not with you I lose my mind
  | G       A   D    Em            F#
    Give me a sign / Hit me, baby, one more time

| Bm - - - | F# - - - | D - - - | Em - F# - |
Oh, baby, baby / The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby / There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

    Show me how you want it to be
    Tell me, baby / 'Cause I need to know now, oh, because...

    | Bm - - - | F# - - - | D - - - | Em - F# - |
    My loneliness / Is killing me (and I)
    I must confess / I still believe (still believe)
    When I'm not with you I lose my mind
  | G       A   D    Em            F#
    Give me a sign / Hit me, baby, one more time
