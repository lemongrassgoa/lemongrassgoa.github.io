ABBA (Cecilia)
Take A Chance On Me (orig B)

    If you change your [A] mind / I'm the first in line
    Honey, I'm still free / Take a chance on [E] me
    If you need me, let me know / Gonna be around
    If you've got no place to go / When you're [A] feeling down

    If you're all [A] alone / When the pretty birds have flown
    Honey, I'm still free / Take a chance on [E] me
    Gonna do my very best / And it ain't no lie
    If you put me to the test / If you [A] let me try
           Bm      ...      E
    Take a chance on me (That's all I ask of you, honey)
    Take a chance on me

[Bm] We can go dancing / We can go walking
[A ] As long as we're together
[Bm] Listen to some music / Maybe just talking
[A ] Get to know you better
                           F#m
'Cause you know I've got / So much that I wanna do
D                                     F#m     D - E
When I dream I'm alone with you, it's magic
F#m                            D
You want me to leave it there / Afraid of a love affair
      Bm             E        Bm          E
but I think you know / That I can't let go

    If you change your [A] mind / I'm the first in line
    Honey, I'm still free / Take a chance on [E] me
    If you need me, let me know / Gonna be around
    If you've got no place to go / When you're [A] feeling down

    If you're all [A] alone / When the pretty birds have flown
    Honey, I'm still free / Take a chance on [E] me
    Gonna do my very best / And it ain't no lie
    If you put me to the test / If you [A] let me try
           Bm      ...      E
    Take a chance on me (Come on, give me a break, will you?)
    Take a chance on me

[Bm] Oh, you can take your time, babe / I'm in no hurry
[A ] I know I'm gonna get you
[Bm] You don't wanna hurt me / Baby, don't worry
[A ] I ain't gonna let you
                    F#m
Let me tell you now / My love is strong enough
D                                   F#m     D - E
To last when things are rough, it's magic
F#m                            D
You say that I waste my time / But I can't get you off my mind
      Bm             E        Bm          E
no, I can't let go / 'Cause I love you so

    If you change your [A] mind / I'm the first in line
    Honey, I'm still free / Take a chance on [E] me
    If you need me, let me know / Gonna be around
    If you've got no place to go / When you're [A] feeling down

    If you're all [A] alone / When the pretty birds have flown
    Honey, I'm still free / Take a chance on [E] me
    Gonna do my very best / Baby, can't you see
    If you put me to the test / Take a [A] chance on me
    (Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)

    Ba-ba-ba, ba, ba / Ba-ba-ba, ba, ba               |
    Honey, I'm still free / Take a chance on me       |
    Gonna do my very best / Baby, can't you see       | 
    Gotta put me to the test / Take a chance on me    | x2 for ending
