Owl City
Fireflies (orig Bb)

(intro riff)
(intro riff + guitar)

| G               C                F
You would not believe your eyes / If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air / And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude / But I would just stand and stare

(strum)
  | FM7         C             Gsus
    I'd like to make myself believe
  |             F     C     Em7/B    F/A
    That planet Earth turns slow  -  ly
  | F                         C
    It's hard to say that I'd rather stay 
  | F          G     Am
    awake when I'm asleep
  | F                    C           D         F
    'Cause everything is never as it seems

| G               C                F
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs / From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head / A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread

  | FM7         Am             Gsus
    I'd like to make myself believe
  |             F     C     Em7/B    F/A

    awake when I'm asleep

    'Cause everything is never as it seems
  |            Am   F
    ... When I fall asleep

| G           C           F
Leave my door open just a crack      (Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac (Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?     (Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

| G               C                F
To ten million fireflies / I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
But I'll know where several are / If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar

  | FM7         Am             Gsus
    I'd like to make myself believe
  |             F     C     Em7/B    F/A

    awake when I'm asleep
  |       F             C           D             G
    Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

    Because my dreams are bursting at the seams
