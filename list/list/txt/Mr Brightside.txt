Mr Brightside
The Killers

| C              C/B                            C/F
Coming out of my cage, and I've been doing just fine
| C/F
Gotta gotta be down, because I want it all
| C                   C/B                          N.C.   
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss

| C             C/B                         C/F
Now I'm falling asleep, and she's calling a cab
| C/F                                         C            
While he's having a smoke, and she's taking a drag
| C                  C/B                    C/F
Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick
| C/F                                           Am7
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his chest now
|                G5                F5              
He takes off her dress now, let me go
| Am7                 G5              F5
I just can't look its killing me, and taking control

| C - - - | C/F - - - | Am7 - - - | Fs4 - - - |
Jealousy, turning saints in-to the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my ea-ger eyes
Cause I'm Mr Brightside
