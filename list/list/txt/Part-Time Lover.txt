Stevie Wonder
Part Time Lover (Capo 3)

              Em
Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
          CM7
To let me know you made it home
                         Am7        Bm7       Em      (B7s4/Eb)
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover 
                  Em
If she isn't with me I'll blink the lights
           CM7
To let you know tonight's the night 
           Am7    Bm7       Em
For me and you my part-time lover 

    Dm7  G7  CM7                       GM7
    We   are undercover passion on the run
            Am7                 Bm7  C   D   Em
    Chasing love up against the su - u - u - un 
    Dm7  G7   CM7                         GM7
    We   are  strangers by day, lovers by night
                    Am7        /G         B7s4-B7
    Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 


            Em
If I'm with friends and we should meet
             CM7
Just pass me by, don't even speak 
                    Am7         Bm7       Em      (B7s4/Eb)
Know the word's "discreet" with part-time lovers 
               Em
But if there's some emergency
            CM7
Have a male friend to ask for me 
                  Am7             Bm7              Em
So then she won't peek its really you my part-time lover 

    Dm7  G7  CM7                       GM7
    We   are undercover passion on the run
            Am7                 Bm7  C   D   Em
    Chasing love up against the su - u - u - un 
    Dm7  G7   CM7                         GM7
    We   are  strangers by day, lovers by night
                    Am7        /G         B7s4-B7
    Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

    Dm7  G7  CM7                       GM7
    We   are undercover passion on the run
            Am7                 Bm7  C   D   Em
    Chasing love up against the su - u - u - un

             Em
I've got something that I must tell
               CM7
Last night someone rang our doorbell 
               Am7    Bm7       Em      (B7s4/Eb)
And it was not you my part-time lover 
           Em
And then a man called our exchange
           CM7
But didn't want to leave his name 
             Am7              Bm7               Em
I guess that two can play the game of part-time lovers 

Em    CM7    Am7  Bm7  Em      (B7s4/Eb)
You and me, part-time lovers 
But, she and he, part-time lovers
