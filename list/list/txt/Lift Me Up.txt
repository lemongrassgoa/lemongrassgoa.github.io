Lift Me Up

    Lift me up / Hold me down
    Keep me close / Safe and sound

Burning in a hopeless dream
Hold me when you go to sleep
Keep me in the warmth of your love
When you depart, keep me safe, safe and sound

    Lift me up / Hold me down
    Keep me close / Safe and sound

Drowning in an endless sea
Take some time and stay with me
Keep me in the strength of your arms
Keep me safe, safe and sound

    Lift me up / Hold me down
    Keep me safe / Safe and sound

Burning in a hopeless dream
Hold me when you go to sleep
Keep me safe, we need light, we need love

(Lift me up)     lift me up in your arms
(Hold me down)   I need love, I need love, I need love
(Keep me close)  hold me, hold me
(Safe and sound) hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
(Lift me up)     hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
(Hold me down)   hold me, hold me
(Keep me safe)   we need light, we need love
