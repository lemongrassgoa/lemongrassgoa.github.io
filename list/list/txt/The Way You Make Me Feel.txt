The Way You Make Me Feel

[ E         D ]
Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your [E7] talk, your dress
[ A           G  ]
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll [B] paint the town
[ E         D ]
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

    [ E         D ]
    The way you make me feel
    You really turn me on
    You knock me off of my feet
    My lonely days are gone

[ E         D ]
I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy
Oh I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you [E7] by my side
[ A           G  ]
I never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me [B] forevermore
[ E         D ]
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

    [ E         D ]
    The way you make me feel
    You really turn me on
    You knock me off of my feet
    My lonely days are gone

(INTERLUDE)

[ A           G  ]
I never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me [B] forevermore
[ E         D ]
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me
