(VERSE 1)
G  G/B      Cadd9         Am7             C       D7(sus4)  G
   Saying I love you / is not the words I want to hear from you
G/B             Cadd9      Am7            C      D    Em
It's not that I want you / not to say but if you only knew
    Am7    D7             G       Bm7/A   Em
How easy / it would be to show me how you feel
Em7       Am7         D7             G7            C
More than words / is all you have to do to make it real
         Cm               G              Em7
Then you wouldn't have to say / that you love me
       Am7   D7    G
'Cause I'd already know

(BRIDGE)
G              D/F#       Em        Bm      C
What would you do / if my heart was torn in two
C                  G/B      Am7              D7             G
More than words to show you feel / that your love for me is real
G              D/F#       Em7        Bm7    C
What would you say / if I took those words away?
C                      C/B    Am7
Then you couldn't make things new
        D7              G
Just by saying I love you

G             Cadd9      Am7             C        D    G
Now that I've tried to / talk to you and make you understand
G            Cadd9           Am7                 C          D        Em
All that you have to do / is close your eyes and just reach out your hand
    Am7        D7                   G    Bm7/A  Em
And touch me / hold  me close don't ever let me go
          Am7        D7         G7            C
More than words / is all I ever needed you to show
         Cm               G              Em7
Then you wouldn't have to say / that you love me
       Am7   D7    G
'Cause I'd already know
