Simon and Garfunkel
The Sound Of Silence Capo 1

Dm                        C                                    Dm
Hello darkness, my old friend / I've come to talk with you again
                      Bb     F                             Bb      F                  
Because a vision softly creeping / Left its seeds while I was sleeping
        Bb                            F                    Dm   F
And the vision that was planted in my brain / Still remains
           C        Dm               
Within the sound of silence.

Dm                           C                              Dm
In restless dreams I walked alone / Narrow streets of cobblestone
Dm                 Bb       F                                Bb       F
'Neath the halo of a street lamp / I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        Bb                                       F                          Dm   F
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light / That split the night
                C        Dm
And touched the sound of silence.


Dm                         C                              Dm
And in the naked light I saw / Ten thousand people, maybe more
                   Bb       F                        Bb       F
People talking without speaking / People hearing without listening
               Bb                      F                      Dm   F
People writing songs that voices never share / And no one dare
            C        Dm
Disturb the sound of silence.


Dm                         C                            Dm
Fools said aye, you do not know / Silence like a cancer grows.
                       Bb        F                           Bb        F
Hear my words that I might teach you / Take my arms that I might reach you.
       Bb                          F        Dm    F  
But my words like silent raindrops fell
                    C        Dm
And echoed / in the wells of silence


Dm                       C                             Dm
And the people bowed and prayed / To the neon God they made.
                          Bb     F                           Bb     F
And the sign flashed out its warning / In the words that it was forming
                       Bb
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
                          F                           Dm  F
Are written on the subway walls / And tenement halls.
                       C         Dm      
And whispered / in the sounds of silence.
