John Mayer
Slow Dancing in a Burning Room (Capo 2)

INTRO:   Bm      G   D    |   x4

VERSE 1: It's not a silly little moment
         it's not the storm before the calm
         This is the deep and dying breath of
         this love that we've been working on
         Can't seem to hold you like I want to
         so I can feel you in my arms
         Nobody's gonna come and save you
         we pulled too many false alarms
         
                     A                  Bm     G
REFRAIN: We're going down / and you can see it too
                     A              Bm              Em7
         We're going down / and you know that we're doomed
         My dear / we're slow dancing in a burning room  -->  (intro theme)
         
VERSE 2: I was the one you always dreamed of
         you were the one I tried to draw
         How dare you say it's nothing to me?
         Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
         I'll make the most of all the sadness
         you'll be a bitch because you can
         You try to hit me just to hurt me
         so you leave me feeling dirty 
         'cause you can't understand
         
(REFRAIN)
