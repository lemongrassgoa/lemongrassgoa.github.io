Only Love Can Hurt Like This
Paloma Faith

I'd tell myself you don't mean a thing
But what we got, got no hold on me?
But when you're not there I just crumble
I tell myself that I don't care that much
But I feel like I'm dying till I feel your touch

    Only love, only love can hurt like this
    Only love can hurt like this
    Must have been a deadly kiss
    Only love can hurt like this

Say I wouldn't care if you walked away
But every time you're there I'm begging you to stay
When you come close I just tremble
And every time, every time you go
It's like a knife that cuts right through my soul

    Only love, only love can hurt like this
    Only love can hurt like this
    Must have been a deadly kiss
    Only love can hurt like this

    Only love can hurt like this
    Your kisses burning to my skin
    Only love can hurt like this

But if the sweetest pain
Burning hot through my veins
Love is torture makes me more sure

...Only love can hurt like this

Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must have been the deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burning to my skin
Only love can hurt like this

Only love can hurt like this
Save me, save me
Only love, only love
'Cause only love can hurt like this
And it must have been the deadly kiss
