VERSE 1: Out the door just in time / head down the 405
         Gotta meet the new boss by 8 a.m.
         The phone rings in the car / the wife is workin' hard
         She's runnin' late tonight again
         
         |       Em                  A                 Em               A
REFRAIN: Well, I know what I've been told / You got to work to feed the soul
         |   Bm              Bm/A     E7
         But I can't do this all on my own
         |   G       A               D ...
         No, I know, I'm no Superman / I'm no Superman
         
         | D                 Dsus2    Gsus2                    G/A
VERSE 2: You've got your love on line / You think you're doing fine
         But you're just plugged into the wall
         And that deck of tarot cards / Won't get you very far
         There ain't no hand to break your fall
         
         |       Em                  A                 Em               A
REFRAIN: Well, I know what I've been told / You gotta know just when to fold
         |   Bm              Bm/A     E7
         But I can't do this all on my own
         |   G       A               D ...
         No, I know, I'm no Superman / I'm no Superman

VERSE 3: You've crossed the finish line / Won the race but lost your mind
         Was it worth it after all?
         [rhythm]
         I need you here with me / 'Cause love is all we need
         Just take a hold of the hand that breaks the fall
