You're Still The One
Shania Twain (orig Eb) [rhythm: Groove 1, bpm: 73]

Looks like we made it / Look how far we've come, my baby
We mighta took the long way / We knew we'd get there someday

They said, "I bet they'll never make it."
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong [Gs2]

| D - - - | G - - - | Em7 - - - | A  -  -   -  |
| D - - - | G - - - |  A  - - - | -  -  Gs2  - |
You're still the one I run to / The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one that I love / The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night

| D - - - | D/F# - - - | G - - - | A - - - |
Ain't nothing better / We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen / Look at what we would be missing

They said, "I bet they'll never make it."
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong [Gs2]

| D - - - | G - - - | Em7 - - - | A  -  -   -  |

You're still the one I run to / The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one that I love / The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
You're still the one

Look how far we've come, my baby  (end on A)
