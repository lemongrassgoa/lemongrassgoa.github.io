INTRO: | A      B           E(5-6-7)

|    A                              E
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
|      A             B               E
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot

  | E              E/D#
    Don't it always seem to go
  |          A/C#                   E/B
    That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
  |      A               B                E
    They paved paradise, put up a parking lot

|    A                                      E
They took all the trees put 'em in a tree museum
|        A                    B                         E
And they charged the people a dollar an' a half just to see 'em

  | E              E/D#
    Don't it always seem to go
  |          A/C#                   E/B
    That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

|   A                              E
Hey farmer, farmer put away that DDT now
|       A                       B                          E
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees / Please

  | E              E/D#
    Don't it always seem to go
  |          A/C#                   E/B
    That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

Late last night I heard the screen door slam
|     A               B                E
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man

  | E              E/D#
    Don't it always seem to go
  |          A/C#                   E/B
    That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
  |      A               B                E(5-6-7)
    They paved paradise, put up a parking lot

    That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone ...
