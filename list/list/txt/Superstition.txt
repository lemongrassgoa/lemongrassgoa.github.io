Stevie Wonder
Superstition (orig. Ebm) [beat: Simple 1; bpm: 100]

Em
Very superstitious / Writing's on the wall
Very superstitious / Ladders bout' to fall,
Thirteen month old baby / Broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck / The good things in your past

	| B7 - C7 - | B7 - Bb7 - | A7 - - - | B7
	When you believe in things / That you don't understand
	Then you suffer / Superstition aint the way

Very superstitious / Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem / Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream / Keep me goin' strong
You don't wanna save me / Sad is the soul

	| B7 - C7 - | B7 - Bb7 - | A7 - - - | B7
	When you believe in things / That you don't understand
	Then you suffer / Superstition aint the way

Very superstitious / Nothin' more to say
Very superstitious / The devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby / Broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck / Good things in your past

	| B7 - C7 - | B7 - Bb7 - | A7 - - - | B7
	When you believe in things / That you don't understand
	Then you suffer / Superstition aint the way
