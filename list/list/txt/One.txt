One (orig. Am)

Em      Am      C       D
Is it getting better?
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now?
You got someone to blame

    G       Em      C       G
    You say, one love, one life
    When it's one need in the night
    One love, we get to share it
    Leaves you baby if you don't care for it

Em      A7      C       D

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

    G       Em      C       G
    Well it's too late / tonight
    To drag the past out into the light
    We're one but we're not the same
    We get to carry each other, carry each other / One!

Em      A7      C       D

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus?
To the lepers in your head

    G       Em      C       G
    Did I ask too much? More than a lot?
    You gave me nothin' now it's all I got
    We're one but we're not the same
    Well we hurt each other then we do it again

G       Em      G       Em
You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
G       D       D       C
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holdin' on to what you got
[C] When all you got is hurt

    G       Em      C       G
    One love, one blood
    One life, you got to do what you should
    One life, with each other
    Sisters, brothers
    One life but we're not the same
    We get to carry each other, carry each other
    One
    One
