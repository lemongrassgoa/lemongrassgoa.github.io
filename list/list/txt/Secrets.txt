Mary Lambert
Secrets

VERSE 1: I've got bi-polar disorder / My shit's not in order
         I'm overweight / I'm always late
         I've got too many things to say
         I rock mom jeans, cat earrings / Extrapolate my feelings
         My family is dysfunctional
         But we have a good time killing each other
         
LINK:    They tell us from the time we're young
         To hide the things that we don't like about ourselves
         Inside ourselves
         I know I'm not the only one
         who spent so long attempting to be someone else
         Well I'm over it
         
REFRAIN: I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are, secrets are  x2
         So-o-o-o-o what   x4
         
VERSE 2: I can't think straight, I'm so gay / Sometimes I cry a whole day
         I care a lot, use an analog clock / And never know when to stop
         And I'm passive, aggressive / I'm scared of the dark and the dentist
         I love my butt and won't shut up / And I never really grew up
