Don't Look Back In Anger
Oasis [rhythm: Groove 1, bpm: 85]

F    C    Dm    A7    Bb   C   F    (Dm>C)
Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away

    Bb    Bbm    F
    So I'll start a revolution from my bed
    'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
    Step outside, summertime's in bloom
    [C] Stand up beside the fireplace
    [A7] Take that look from off your face
    Dm             C             Bb              C
    You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

    F    C    Dm    A7    Bb   C   F
    And so Sally can wait
    She knows it's too late as we're walking on by (Dm>C)
    My soul slides away
    "But don't look back in anger," I heard you say
    
    (short interlude, same chords)

F    C    Dm    A7    Bb   C   F
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day (Dm>C)
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock 'n' Roll band
Who'll throw it all away

    Bb    Bbm    F
    I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
    'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
    Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
    [C] Stand up beside the fireplace
    [A7] Take that look from off your face
    Dm             C             Bb              C
    You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

    F    C    Dm    A7    Bb   C   F
    And so Sally can wait
    She knows it's too late as she's walking on by (Dm>C)
    My soul slides away
    "But don't look back in anger," I heard you say

I heard you say ... at least not today.
