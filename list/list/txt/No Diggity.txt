Chet Faker
No Diggity (orig. Gm)

Gm		Dm/F		C
Shorty get down, good Lord / Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound

Getting paid is a forte / Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
I think about the girl all the time

East side to the West side / Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash / Stacking up cash
Fast when it comes to the gas

By no means average / As long as she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten

	I like the way you work it / No diggity, I gotta bag it up  | x4

She's got class and style / Seen knowledge by the mile
Baby, never act wild / Very low-key on the profile

Catching feelings is a no / Let me tell you how it goes
Curves the words, spins the verbs
Lovers, it curves so freak what you heard

(Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh)
	Man, that girl look good
	Play on, play on
	She's got class and style
	No diggity, no doubt y'all
	
    (silent break)

	I like the way you work it / No diggity, I gotta bag it up  | x4
	
(Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh)
	I like the way you work it / No diggity, I gotta bag it up  | x4
