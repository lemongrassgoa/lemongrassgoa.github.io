She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"
He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

    | Dm - - - | C/D - - - | BbM7/D - - - | C/D  - - - |
    Oh think twice
    it's another day for you and me in paradise
    | Dm - - - | C/D - - - | BbM7/D - - - | C-Dm-C-Bb |
    Oh think twice
    it's just another day for you
    You and me in pa-ra-dise

(intro riff)
| Dm7 - - - | C - Gm7 - |   x4
Think about it

| Dm7 - - - | C - Gm7 - | Dm7 - - - | C - - - | 
She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying

    | Dm - - - | C/D - - - | BbM7/D - - - | C/D  - - - |
    Oh think twice
    it's another day for you and me in paradise
    | Dm - - - | C/D - - - | BbM7/D - - - | C-Dm-C-Bb |
    Oh think twice
    it's just another day for you
    You and me in pa-ra-dise

(intro riff)
| Dm7 - - - | C - Gm7 - |   x4
Just think about it

    | C - - - | Dm - - - | C - - - | F - - - |
    Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do
    Oh lord, there must be something you can say ...

| Dm7 - - - | C - Gm7 - | Dm7 - - - | C - - - | 
You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cos she didn't fit in there

    | Dm - - - | C/D - - - | BbM7/D - - - | C/D  - - - |
    Oh think twice
    it's another day for you and me in paradise
    | Dm - - - | C/D - - - | BbM7/D - - - | C-Dm-C-Bb |
    Oh think twice
    it's just another day for you
    You and me in pa-ra-dise

Just think about it / Mm-hmm
It's just another day / for you and me / in paradise
It's just another day / for you and me / in paradise
