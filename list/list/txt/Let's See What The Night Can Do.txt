Let's See What The Night Can Do (orig G)

G                      G/F#      Em
Let's drive out to the desert at midnight
   Em           G/D         Cadd9
To dance in the dust of our headlights
    C                             G      D
And score some good seats for the sunrise
        G                              G/F#         Em
And get dressed up in clothes we don't mind getting messed up
     Em          G/D         Cadd9
When no one will know how to get us
   C                              G             D
We don't need the map, we'll just drive, drive, drive

      Em                  Cadd9
    I wanna get lost with you
        G                       Ds4
    And hide out, out under the light of the moon
      Em                  Cadd9
    I wanna get lost with you
        Am                    D               Eb-
    And see what it's like to spend the whole night
         Em        C     G         D
    With you, just you / You, just you

G                          G/F#      Em
We can head North over the oceans of turquoise
      Em      G/D               Cadd9
Where after a while there'll be no noise
C                           G          D       G
Except for the sound of our heartbeats beating on
          G            G/F#    Em
And we'll stand in the Canyon alone
Em          G/D      Cadd9
Singing our favorite songs
    C                       G                       D
And wait for the words to return in the echo, echo, echo, echo, echo

      Em                  Cadd9
    I wanna get lost with you
        G                       Ds4
    And hide out, out under the light of the moon
      Em                  Cadd9
    I wanna get lost with you
        Am                    D               Eb-
    And see what it's like to spend the whole night
         Em        C     G         D
    With you, just you / With you, just you
         Em        C     G         D
    With you, just you / With you, just you

    F   G           F   Am   D
And I ... wanna get lost

G    Em     Cadd9     G
Let's see what the night can do    x3
I wanna get [D] lost
Let's see what the night can do    x3
I wanna get [D] lost
Let's see what the night can do    x3
I wanna get [D] lost

Let's see what the night can do (I wanna get lost with you)
                   G7           CM7
Let's see what our hearts wanna do
        Am7                    D               Eb-
I wanna know what it's like to spend the whole night
     Em        C     G         D
With you, just you / With you, just you
     Em        C     G        D    G
With you, just you
