Stuck In The Middle With You  [rhythm: Simple 3, bpm: 120]

[D7] Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
     I got the feeling that something ain't right
[G7] I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
[D7] And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
[A7] Clowns to the left of me, [C7] jokers to the [G7] right
[D7] Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
   
[D7] Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
     And I'm wondering what it is I should do
[G7] It's so hard to keep this smile from my face
[D7] Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place
[A7] Clowns to the left of me, [C7] jokers to the [G7] right
[D7] Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
   
[G7] Well, you started off with nothing
     And you're proud that you're a self-made man [D7]
[G7] And your friends they all come crawlin'
     Slap you on the back and say, "[D7] Please, [A7] please"
   
[D7] Trying to make some sense of it all
     But I can see it makes no sense at all
[G7] Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor?
[D7] Well, I don't think I can take anymore
[A7] Clowns to the left of me, [C7] jokers to the [G7] right
[D7] Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
   
[G7] Well, you started off with nothing
     And you're proud that you're a self-made man [D7]
[G7] And your friends they all come crawlin'
     Slap you on the back and say, "[D7] Please, [Am7] please"
   
[D7] Yeah, I don't know why I came here tonight
     I got the feeling that something ain't right
[G7] I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
[D7] And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
[A7] Clowns to the left of me, [C7] jokers to the [G7] right
[D7] Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
   
     Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
     Stuck in the middle with you
     Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
