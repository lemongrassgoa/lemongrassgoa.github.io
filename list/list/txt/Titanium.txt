Titanium
David Guetta ft Sia (orig Eb) [rhythm: Simple 4, bpm: 135]

[single strums]
C    G/B     Am     %  /  C     Em    Am      %    
You shout it out / But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

    F      G      Em      Am
    I'm bulletproof nothing to lose, Fire away, fire away
    Ricochet, you take your aim, Fire away, fire away
    You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
    You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium

[rhythm start]
C    G/B     Am     %  /  C     Em    Am      %    
Cut me down / But it's you who have further to fall
Ghost town, haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud not saying much

    F      G      Em      Am
    I'm bulletproof nothing to lose, Fire away, fire away
    Ricochet, you take your aim, Fire away, fire away
    You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
    You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
    I am titanium, I am titanium

F      G      Em      Am
Stone-hard, machine gun / Firing at the ones who run
F      G      Em      %
Stone-hard, those bulletproof guns

F      G      Em      Am
You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
I am titanium
