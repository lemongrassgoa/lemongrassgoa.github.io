Men At Work
Overkill

(VERSE 1)
D        F#m/C#          C           G/B
I can't get to sleep / I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep  /  And possibly the complications
Especially at night / I worry over situations
I know we'll be alright / Perhaps it's just imagination

Day after day it reappears  /  Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
F#sus4   F#             G     Asus             A
Ghosts appear and fade away (Come back another day)

(VERSE 2)
D              F#m/C#  C                 G/B
Alone between the sheets / Only brings exasperation
It's time to walk the streets / Smell the desperation
At least there's pretty lights / And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night / from overkill
