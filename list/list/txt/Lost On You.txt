Lost On You (orig Fm) (capo 1) [rhythm: Groove 1, bpm: 90]

Am     D     Em
When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger we came from?
Burning like embers, falling, tender
Long before the days of no surrender, Years ago / and well you know

Smoke 'em if you got 'em 'cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven 'cause I don't know how
Let's raise a glass or two

    Am     D     Em     C
    To all the things I've lost on you, oohh
    Tell me are they lost on you? Oohh
    Just thought you could cut me loose, oohh
    After everything I've lost on you? Is that lost on you?

    Oooohhh / Oooohhh
    Is that lost on you?
    Oooohhh / Oooohhh
    Baby, is that lost on you? Is that lost on you?

Am     D     Em
Wishing I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations in your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me all the time
And you're still mine

Smoke 'em if you got 'em 'cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink of heaven, this can turn around
Let's raise a glass or two

    Am     D     Em     C
    To all the things I've lost on you, oohh
    Tell me are they lost on you? Oohh
    Just thought you could cut me loose, oohh
    After everything I've lost on you? Is that lost on you?

    Oooohhh / Oooohhh
    Is that lost on you?
    Oooohhh / Oooohhh
    Baby, is that lost on you? Is that lost on you?
    
(interlude)

Let's raise a glass or two

Am     D     Em     C
To all the things I've lost on you, oohh
Tell me are they lost on you? Oohh
Just thought you could cut me loose, oohh
After everything I've lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
