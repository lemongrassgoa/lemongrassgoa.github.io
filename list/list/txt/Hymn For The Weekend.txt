Hymn For The Weekend
Coldplay (ft. Beyoncé) [rhythm: 16th Shuffle 2, bpm: 90]

(C:)
Oh, angel sent from up above / You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt / You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug / Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river, dried up / You came to rain a flood

(Both:) And said drink from me, drink from me
(   C:) When I was so thirsty
(Both:) Pour on a symphony
(   C:) Now I just can't get enough
(Both:) Put your wings on me, wings on me
(   C:) When I was so heavy
(Both:) Pour on a symphony
(   C:) When I'm low, low, low, low

(C:)
I, oh I, oh I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

(interlude)  oooh ...

(Chris Martin & Beyoncé:)
Oh, angel sent from up above / I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about / To make the stars come out

(Both:) Put your wings on me, wings on me
(   C:) When I was so heavy
(Both:) Pour on a symphony
(   C:) When I'm low, low, low, low

(Chris Martin:)
I, oh I, oh I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

(Beyoncé)
I, oh I, oh I
La la la la la la la
So high, so high
(Beyoncé & Coldplay:)
I, oh I, oh I
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
