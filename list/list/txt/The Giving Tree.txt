The Giving Tree

INTRO:   Bm    D    Em     D  A

         Bm    D    Em     D  A
VERSE 1: All the leaves on the Giving Tree have fallen
         No shade to crawl in underneath
         I've got scars from a pocket knife
         Where you carved your heart into me
         
                    G          D                    A      D
REFRAIN: If all you wanted was love / Why would you use me up
                G             A               D    D7
         Cut me down, build a boat, and sail away
                    G         D      F#7         Bm    A
         When all I wanted to be was your giving tree
                G             A                  D        |
         Settle down, build a home, and make you happy?   |   (repeat for outro)
         
         Bm     D     Em      D   A
VERSE 2: I lie in the dead of night and I wonder
         Whose covers you're between
         And it's sad laying in his bed
         You feel hollow, so you crawl home back to me

(REFRAIN)

         Em7    G    D    A(7)
BRIDGE:  Well, I see a trail that starts
         A line of broken hearts behind you
         That lead you back to me
         The once sad and lonely fool
         With nothing left but roots to show, oh

(REFRAIN)
