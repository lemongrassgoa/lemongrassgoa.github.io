INTRO: | D   Bm7   E7   G(/A)  |  x2
       | D   Bm7   E7    Gm  Em7(b5)/A  D  A7s

| D     Bm7     E7           G     G/A     D      A7s
You're a falling star, you're the getaway car
You're the line in the sand when I go too far
You're the swimming pool on an August day
And you're the perfect thing to say
| D     Bm7     E7           Gm    A7s     D     (A7s)
And you play it coy, but it's kinda cute
Oh, when you smile at me you know exactly what you do
Baby don't pretend that you don't know it's true
'Cause you can see it when I look at you

|   G   A      D   Bm7          G   A     D   D7
    And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times

    It's you, it's you, you make me sing
|   E7   Gm   Em7(b5)/A   D
    You're every line, you're every word, you're everything

| D     Bm7     E7           Gm    A7s     D     A7s

| D     Bm7     E7           G     G/A     D      A7s
You're a carousel, you're a wishing well
And you light me up when you ring my bell
You're a mystery, you're from outer space
You're every minute of my every day
| D     Bm7     E7           Gm    A7s     D     (A7s)
And I can't believe, oh that I'm your man
And I get to kiss you baby just because I can
Whatever comes our way, oh we'll see it through
And you know that's what our love can do.
