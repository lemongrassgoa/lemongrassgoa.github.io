    Havana, ooh na-na
    Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na
    He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
    Oh, but my heart is in Havana
    There's somethin' 'bout his manners
    Havana, ooh na-na

He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?"
                        (When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with
                        (But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute
                        (That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him
He got me feelin' like

Oooh... I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Oooh... and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na

    Havana, ooh na-na
    Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na
    He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
    Oh, but my heart is in Havana
    My heart is in Havana
    Havana, ooh na-na

I knew I was there when I read the sign
                        (Welcome to La Yuma)
I knew it was him when he hugged from behind
                        (It gets me every time)
He's put in work, but it's in the streets
                        (He said, girl, can you ride?)
And this is the part that my daddy told me
He got me feelin' like

Oooh... I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Oooh... and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na

    Havana, ooh na-na
    Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na
    He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
    Oh, but my heart is in Havana
    My heart is in Havana
    Havana, ooh na-na

Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na
Take me back, back, back
Take me back to my Havana...

    Havana, ooh na-na
    Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na
    He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
    Oh, but my heart is in Havana
    My heart is in Havana
    Havana, ooh na-na
