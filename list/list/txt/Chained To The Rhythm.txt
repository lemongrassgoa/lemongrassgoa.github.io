Katy Perry
Chained To The Rhythm

| Em    Am    CM7
Are we crazy? / Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence / Like ornaments
[G]  So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
[Bm] So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

| Em    Am    CM7
Aren't you lonely? / Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough / Happily numb
[G]  So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
[Bm] So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

| C   Am7  G                     Em               Bm7      B7
      So   put your rose-colored glasses on / and party on

| Em    Am    CM7    G    Bm  (B)                
Turn it up, it's your favorite song            \
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion          |
Turn it up, keep it on repeat                  |
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie, yeah    |
We think we're free                            |   x2
Drink, this one's on me                        |
We're all chained to the rhythm                |
To the rhythm                                  |
To the rhythm                                  /

| Em    Am    CM7
Are we tone deaf? / Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that / I hope we can
[G]  So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
[Bm] So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

| C   Am7  G                     Em               Bm7      B7
      So   put your rose-colored glasses on / and party on

| Em    Am    CM7    G    Bm  (B)                
Turn it up, it's your favorite song            \
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion          |

Drink, this one's on me                        |
We're all chained to the rhythm                |
To the rhythm                                  |
To the rhythm                                  /

    | Am7 - - /B | CM7 - - /D | Em - - - | D - - - |
    It is my desire
    Break down the walls to connect, inspire
    Ay, up in your high place, liars
    Time is ticking for the empire
    The truth they feed is feeble
    As so many times before
    They greed over the people
    They stumbling and fumbling
    And we about to riot
    They woke up, they woke up the lions
    (Woo!)

| Em    Am    CM7    G    Bm  (B)                
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie, yeah
We think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm
