INTRO: |  C   E7   Am   D7   /   Dm7    Fm

| C        Am                   Dm7              G                         C
 It's all about you (It's about you) / It's all about you, baby (It's all about)
| C        Am                   Dm7              G(sus)
 It's all about you (It's about you) / It's all about you

| C            E7                   Am
Yesterday, you asked me something I thought you knew
|    F               G                       C     G
So I told you with a smile / "It's all about you"
| C                E7                Am      Am/G
Then you whispered in my ear and you told me too
|          F                 G                      C     C7
Said, "You make my life worthwhile / it's all about you"

|   F              Fm                C      G/B      Am
And I would answer all your wishes / if you asked me to.
|      D7                              G                        G+
But if you deny me one of your kisses / don't know what I'd do
| C                  E7                       Am
So hold me close and say three words like you used to do
|C/G    F              G                      C     G
Dancing on the kitchen tiles / it's all about you / Yeah ...
