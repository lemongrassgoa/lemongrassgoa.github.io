La Isla Bonita (orig C#m)

INTRO: Bm    A

Bm           A             Bm
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
G      Bm7      D             A
  Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Bm                A             Bm
A young girl with eyes like the desert
G    Bm7             D              A    /Bb
  It all seems like yesterday, not far away

    Bm           F#m7            Em            D
    Tropical the island breeze / All of nature wild and free
    A               Em                   Bm
    This is where I long to be / La isla bonita
    Bm           F#m7         Em              D
    And when the samba played / The sun would set so high
         A                   Em                                Bm
    Ring through my ears and sting my eyes / Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
G      Bm7          D              A
  Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Bm    A        Bm
   Te dijo te amo
G   Bm7             D              A    /Bb
