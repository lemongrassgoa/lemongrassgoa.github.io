Survivor
Eye Of The Tiger [rhythm: Groove 1, bpm: 110]

(INTRO) | Am   %   [Am-G-Am]   %    Am-Em-F

(single strums)
| Am      F       G       Am
Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive

So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

|   G    Am    Dm                          C             G
    It's the   eye of the tiger / It's the thrill of the fight
|          Dm                         Am   G
    Rising up to the challenge of our ri - val
|   G   Am    Dm                             C           G
    And the   last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
|            Dm7         Em7          F            Am
    And he's watching us all with the eye / of the tiger

| Am      F       G       Am
Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds still we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

|   G    Am    Dm                          C             G
    It's the   eye of the tiger / It's the thrill of the fight
|          Dm                         Am   G
    Rising up to the challenge of our ri - val
|   G   Am    Dm                             C           G
    And the   last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
|            Dm7         Em7          F            Am
    And he's watching us all with the eye / of the tiger

| Am      F       G       Am
Rising up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

|   G    Am    Dm                          C             G
    It's the   eye of the tiger / It's the thrill of the fight
|          Dm                         Am   G
    Rising up to the challenge of our ri - val
|   G   Am    Dm                             C           G
    And the   last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
|            Dm7         Em7          F               Am
