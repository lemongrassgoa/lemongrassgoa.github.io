|                                               G(s4)
    How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
|                          D             C         D

    Chiquitita, you and I cry

    Sing a new song, Chiquitita

    Sing a new song, Chiquitita                /

| G - C/G                           G                 D
  So the walls came tumbling down / And your love's a blown out candle
| D   C     D                     G - C/G
  All    is gone and it seems too hard to handle
| G - C/G                         G               Bm
  Chiquitita, tell me the truth / There is no way you can deny it
