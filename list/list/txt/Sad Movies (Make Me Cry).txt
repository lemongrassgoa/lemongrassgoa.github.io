I saw my darling and my best friend walking in.

Although I was sitting right there they didn't see me.
And so they both sat right down in front of me.
And when he kissed her lips I almost died.
And in the middle of the colour cartoon I started to cry.

And Mama saw the tears and said "Baby what is wrong".
And so just to keep from telling her a lie,
I just said "Sad movies ... make me cry".

Oh Sad movies always make me cry
Sad movies always make me cry
