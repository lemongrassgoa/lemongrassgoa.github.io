How Deep Is Your Love (orig. Eb) (Capo 1) [rhythm: Pop 1, bpm: 105]
 
D  DM7  GM7  G/A   x2
 
             D          F#m7    Em7
I know your eyes in the morning sun
B7         Em7             F#7      G/A
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
        D               F#m7   Bm7
And the moment that you wander far from me
        Em7                   G/A
I wanna feel you in my arms again
 
             GM7             F#m7
    Then you come to me on a summer breeze
            Em7                         C9
    Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
             F#m7           G/A
    And it's me you need to show     (How deep is your love)

        D                      DM7
    How deep is your love, how deep is your love
    GM7              Gm6
    I really mean to learn
                 D                    Am/C               B7
    'Cause we're living in a world of fools, breaking us down
                                Em7       Gm6            D
    When they all should let us be, we belong to you and me
 
 
 F#m7    Em7
I believe in you
B7            Em7       F#7   G/A
You know the door to my very soul
            D           F#m7    Bm7
You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
           Em7            G/A
You're my saviour when I fall
        GM7             F#m7
And you may not think I care for you
         Em7                      C9
When you know down inside that I really do
         F#m7           G/A
And it's me you need to show     (How deep is your love)

        D                      DM7
    How deep is your love, how deep is your love
    GM7              Gm6
    I really mean to learn
                 D                    Am6                B7
    'Cause we're living in a world of fools, breaking us down
                                Em7       Gm6            D
    When they all should let us be, we belong to you and me
