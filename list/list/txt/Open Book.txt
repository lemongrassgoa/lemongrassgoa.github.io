Open Book

| C    /B  /A  /B    /    F/C   /B  /A  /B
I guess my life's an open book
Anyone can take a look
No secrets here to hide this is just me
Holidays, they come and go
Feelings change, people grow
And all I know is I like being free

    | Em   Am   F   G
    Da da da / I'll be fine
    This is me now / But I could change, anytime

| C    /B  /A  /B    /    F/C   /B  /A  /B
I guess my life's an open book
Everything I gave and took
Is written on my face for all to see
Even when I'm grey and old
Promise me you'll always know
That I carry you around somewhere in me

    | Em   Am   F   G
    Da da da / I'll be fine
    This is me now / But I could change, anytime

    But oh, how people come and go
    Life is just a show
    We make it all up as we go
    There is no script just let it flow
    And oh how nothing seems to last
    Days go superfast
    Well at least we had a blast
    We really had a blast
         
(interlude - verse)
         
    | Em   Am   F   G
    Da da da / I'll be fine
    I'll see you again / Another place, another time

    | Em7    Am7    FM7    C    BbM7    Am
    But oh, how people come and go
    Life is just a show
    We make it all up as we go
    There is no script just let it flow
    And oh how nothing seems to last
    Days go superfast
    Well at least we had a blast
    Didn't we have a blast?
