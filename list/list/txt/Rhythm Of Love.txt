VERSE 1: My head is stuck in the clouds / She begs me to come down

         Says, Boy quit foolin' around / I told her
         G                       D      G                       D
         I love the view from up here / Warm sun and wind in my ear

         We'll watch the world from above

         Em       D     C         D(7)                  G
         Play the music low / and sway to the rhythm of love

VERSE 2: My heart beats like a drum / A guitar string to the strum
         A beautiful song to be sung / She's got
         Blue eyes deep like the sea / That roll back when she's laughing at me
         She rises up like the tide / The moment her lips meet mine
