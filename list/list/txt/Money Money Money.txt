Am                                  E7/G#
I work all night, I work all day to pay the bills I have to pay
E7       Am
Ain't it sad?
Am                                  E7/G#
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
E7         Am
That's too bad
Am                           F
In my dreams I have a plan / If I got me a wealthy man
  Dm                            B7/D#                           E
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball ...

    Am                  B7              E7                  Am
    Money, money, money / Must be funny / In the rich man's world
    Money, money, money / Always sunny  / In the rich man's world
      Dm   E7    A7                       Dm
    A-ha - a   /   All the things I could do
    F7   E7   Am                 Dm7      E7         Am   (intro)  B7
    If   I    had a little money / It's a rich man's world
    Dm7      E7         Am
      It's a rich man's world

Am                                  E7/G#
A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
E7       Am
Ain't it sad?
Am                             E7/G#
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me
E7         Am
That's too bad
Am                               F
So I must leave, I'll have to go / To Las Vegas or Monaco
    Dm                          B7/D#                        E
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same

    Am                  B7              E7                  Am
    Money, money, money / Must be funny / In the rich man's world
