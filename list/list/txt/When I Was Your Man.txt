When I Was Your Man
Bruno Mars

INTRO:   D7    Dm7    C   /    D7   Dm7   C       Em

         Am    C    Dm(7)   /   G7    C    Em
VERSE 1: Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
         Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
         When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
         'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
         
            Em                   Am   Em      Bb                             C/G
REFRAIN: It all just sounds like oooooh ... / Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
              G                      F       G               C
         That I should've bought you flowers / And held your hand
                                   F      G               C
         Should've gave you all my hours / When I had the chance
                           F                      G                Am
         Take you to every party / 'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
         D7            F                   Fm                   C     (F - C     Em)
         Now my baby's dancing / But she's dancing with another man
         
         Am    C    Dm(7)   /   G7      C    Em
VERSE 2: My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
         Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
         Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, ohh ...
         And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
         
(REFRAIN)
         
                    F
BRIDGE: Although it hurts
                    G                       C    G/B   Am   Em/G 
        I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
              D7
        Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
                    Dm7
        To try and apologize for my mistakes
                   G
        But I just want you to know
         
                            F       G                      C
OUTRO:  I hope he buys you flowers / I hope he holds your hand
                          F      G                C
         Give you all his hours / When he has the chance
                           F                  G                            Am
         Take you to every party / 'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
         D7                  F               Fm                 C
         Do all the things I should have done / When I was your man
         D7                  F               Fm                 C
         Do all the things I should have done / When I was your man
