Am-Am(#5)-Am(6)  ...  E7

                     Bm7b5    E7
When marimba rhythms start to play
Bm7b5      E7   Am
Dance with me,  make me sway
                  Dm7      E7
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Dm7     E7     Am
Hold me close, sway me more

                      Bm7b5   E7
Like a flower bending in  the breeze
Bm7b5     E7   Am
Bend with me,  sway with ease
                         Dm7      E7
When we dance you have a way with me
Dm7       E7   Am
Stay with me,  sway with me

                      G            G7s4-G+
    Other dancers may be on the floor
                           C(6)
    Dear, but my eyes will see only you
                       E(7)
    Only you have that magic technique
                      F7-E7
    When we sway I go weak

                         Bm7b5   E7
I can hear the sounds of vio  -  lins
Bm7b5    E7   Am
Long  be-fore it begins
                       Dm7      E7
Make me thrill as only you know how
Dm7     E7      Am
Sway me smooth, sway me now
