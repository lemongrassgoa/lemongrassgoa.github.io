INTRO: | G

(VERSE 1)
|               G                    C
Things could be greener / I could be too 
|      D7                         G    C    G
I'm on vacation / From feeling so blue 
|               G                       C
The morning was orange / The sky like a peach 
|         D7                           G    C    G
And every rainbow / Just outside of my reach 

(BRIDGE 1)
|     C                      A    G
But I knew when I tied up my shoe-strings
|    C                          G    Bm(7)
That daylight had knocked out a wall 
|      Em                          A7
and my head felt so light / and so full of hot air 
|     C                 D(7)
I was braced for a fall 

(VERSE 2)
|              G                        C
In my lavender daydreams / I giggle and play 
|               D7                       G    C    G
My lips, red as roses / Golden sun on my face 
|                    G                                  C
I am walking through tall trees / steps light on the ground 
|            D7                                                         G    C    G
Over emerald mosses, chocolate soil / and leaves in bright scarlets and browns 

(BRIDGE 2)
|       C                         A  G          C                         G    Bm(7)
And the sky is like Earl grey and le-mons / The trees are as strong as my will 
|       Em                          A7
and I'm here and I'm home / But I'm restless when I just 
|  C                 D(7)
forget to sit still 

(interlude?)

(VERSE 3)
|               G                    C
Things could be sweeter / I could be too 
|               D7                            G    C    G
But darlin' I'm grayscale / when I'm far from you 
|                      G                             C
Yeah, your love is the brightness / Your love is the sea 
|                    D7                                          G    C  D7  G
and the world is our forest, oh come / Live in the treetops with me
