"The problem is all inside your head", she said to me
| Em           Eb-         F#-            B+
"The answer is easy if you take it logically
| Em        D                CM7            B7-9
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
|            Em7    Am7                Em
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover"

| Em/G         D             CM7         B7-9
She said "It's really not my habit to intrude
|      Em              Eb-              F#-            B+
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
|          Em         D       CM7           B7-9
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
|             Em7    Am7                Em
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover

    Just slip out the back, Jack
    Make a new plan, Stan
    You don't need to be coy, Roy
    Just get yourself free (Just listen to me)
    Hop on the bus, Gus
    You don't need to discuss much
    Just drop off the key, Lee
    And get yourself free

| Em/G       D                CM7             B7-9
She said "It grieves me so to see you in such pain
|                Em                Eb-   F#-             B+
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again"
|          Em7           D     CM7                B7-9
I said "I appreciate that, and would you please explain
|            Em7       Am7     Em
About the fifty ways?"

| Em/G        D                  CM7           B7-9
She said "Why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
|       Em                Eb-              F#-            B+
And I believe that in the morning you'll begin to see the light"
|            Em7             D            CM7          B7-9
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right
|             Em7    Am7                Em
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
              Fifty ways to leave your lover"
