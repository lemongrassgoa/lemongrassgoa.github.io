Buffalo Springfield
For What Its Worth [rhythm: Groove 1, bpm: 100]

(INTRO) | E   A   E   A
 
| E           A
There's somethin' happenin' here.
What it is ain't exactly clear.
There's a man with a gun over there
A-tellin' me I've got to beware.
 
    |                    E               D
    I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound?
    | A                   C
    Everybody look what's goin' down.
 
| E   A   E   A
 
| E           A
There's battle lines bein' drawn.
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong.
Young people speakin' their minds
A-gettin' so much resistance from behind.
 
    |                    E          D
    I think it's time we stop, hey, what's that sound?
    | A                   C
    Everybody look what's goin' down.
 
| E   A   E   A
 
| E             A       G/A
What a field day for the heat.
A thousand people in the street
Singin' songs and a-carryin' signs
Mostly sayin' hooray for our side.
 
    |                    E          D
    I think it's time we stop, hey, what's that sound?
    | A                   C
    Everybody look what's goin' down.
 
| E   A   E   A
 
| E             A       G/A
Paranoia strikes deep.
Into your life it will creep.
It starts when you're always afraid.
Step out of line, the men come and take you away.
