Last week I left a note on Laura's desk
It said "I love you" signed 'anonymous friend'
Turns out she's smarter than I thought she was
She knows I wrote it, now the whole class does too
And I'm all alone during couple's skate
When she skates by with some guy on her arm
But I know that I'll forget the look of pity in her face
When I'm living in my solar dome on a platform in space


    Cause it's gonna be the future soon
    I won't always be this way
    When the things that make me weak and strange get 
    engineered away
    It's gonna be the future soon
    never seen it quite so clear
    And when my heart is breaking I can close my eyes and
    it's already here


I'll probably be some kind of scientist
Building inventions in my space lab in space
I'll end world hunger I'll make dolphins speak
Work through the daytime, spend my nights and weekends
Perfecting my warrior robot race
Building them one laser gun at a time
I will do my best to teach them
About life and what it's worth
I just hope that I can keep them from destroying the Earth


    Here on Earth they'll wonder
    As I piece by piece replace myself
    And the steel and circuits will make me whole
    But I'll still feel so alone
    until Laura calls me home


I'll see her standing by the monorail
She'll look the same except for bionic eyes
She lost the real ones in the robot wars
I'll say I'm sorry, she'll say it's not your fault
Or is it?
And she eyes me suspiciously
Hearing the whir of the servos inside
She will scream and try to run
But there's nowhere she can hide
When a crazy cyborg wants to make you his robot bride



















Welcome to my secret lair on Skullcrusher Mountain
I hope that you've enjoyed your stay so far
I see you've met my assistant Scarface
His appearance is quite disturbing
But I assure you he's harmless enough
He's a sweetheart, calls me master
And he has a way of finding pretty things and bringing them to me

    Oh, and I'm so into you
    But I'm way too smart for you
    Even my henchmen think I'm crazy
    I'm not surprised that you agree
    If you could find some way to be
    A little bit less afraid of me
    You'd see the voices that control me from inside my head
    Say I shouldn't kill you yet

I made this half-pony, half-monkey monster to please you
But I get the feeling that you don't like it
What's with all the screaming?
You like monkeys, you like ponies
Maybe you don't like monsters so much
Maybe I used too many monkeys
Isn't it enough to know that I ruined a pony making a gift for you?


    Picture the two of us alone inside my golden submarine
    While up above the waves my doomsday squad ignites the atmosphere
    And all the fools who lead their foolish lives may find it quite explosive
    Well it won't mean half as much to me if I don't have you here

You know it isn't easy living here on Skullcrusher Mountain
Maybe you could cut me just a little slack
Would it kill you to be civil?
I've been patient, I've been gracious
And this mountain is covered with wolves
Hear them howling, my hungry children
Maybe you should stay and have another drink and think about me and you















Heya Tom, it's Bob from the office down the hall
It's good to see you buddy, how've you been?
Things have been OK for me except that I'm a zombie now
I really wish you'd let us in
I think I speak for all of us when I say I understand
Why you folks might hesitate to submit to our demand
But here's an FYI: you're all gonna die screaming

    All we want to do is eat your brains
    We're not unreasonable, I mean, no one's gonna eat your eyes
    All we want to do is eat your brains
    We're at an impasse here, maybe we should compromise:
    If you open up the doors
    We'll all come inside and eat your brains

I don't want to nitpick, Tom, but is this really your plan?
Spend your whole life locked inside a mall?
Maybe that's OK for now but someday you'll be out of food and guns
And you'll have to make the call
I'm not surprised to see you haven't thought it through enough
You never had the head for all that bigger picture stuff
But Tom, that's what I do, and I plan on eating you slowly

    I'd like to help you Tom, in any way I can
    I sure appreciate the way you're working with me
    I'm not a monster Tom, well, technically I am
    I guess I am

I've got another meeting Tom, maybe we could wrap it up
I know we'll get to common ground somehow
Meanwhile I'll report back to my colleagues who were chewing on the doors
I guess we'll table this for now
I'm glad to see you take constructive criticism well
Thank you for your time I know we're all busy as hell
And we'll put this thing to bed
When I bash your head open
