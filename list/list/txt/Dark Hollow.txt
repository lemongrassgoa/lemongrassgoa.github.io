Dark Hollow

C    G    C    %
I'd rather be in some dark hollow
C    F    C    %
where the sun don't ever shine
C    C7   F    F7
Then to be at home alone and knowin' that you're gone
C    G    C    %
Would cause me to lose my mind.

    So blow your whistle freight train
    take me far on down the track
    Well I'm going away, I'm leaving today
    I'm goin', but I ain't comin' back.

(interlude)

I'd rather be in some dark hollow
where the sun don't ever shine
Then to be in some big city
in a small room, with you upon my mind.

    So blow your whistle freight train
    take me far on down the track
    Well I'm going away, I'm leaving today
    I'm goin', but I ain't comin' back.
