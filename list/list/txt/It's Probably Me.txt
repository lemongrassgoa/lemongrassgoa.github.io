Sting ft. Eric Clapton
It's Probably Me

Em  %  Am    D    Em
If the night turned cold and the stars looked down
And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground
You wake the morning in a stranger's coat
No one would you see
Am7    Bm7    Em    A7  []   CM7   B7   Em  %
You ask yourself, who'd watch for me
My only friend, who could it be
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

Em  %  Am    D    Em
When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the city for your only friend
No one would you see
Am7    Bm7    Em    A7  []   CM7   B7   Em  %
Ask yourself, who'd watch for me
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

Am7   D   G   Em 
You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way
You'll only make me cry
Am7    Bm7    Em    A7  []   CM7   B7   Em  %
But if there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

(interlude)

Em  %  Am    D    G
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
And the jury's out and your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see
Am7    Bm7    Em    A7  []   CM7   B7   Em  %
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
