INTRO: Em7    G    Ds4    A7s4  |  x4

| Em7  -  G  -  | Ds4  -  A7s4  -  |
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
| Cadd9  -  Ds4  -  | A7s4  -  -  -  |
About you now

| Em7  -  G  -  | Ds4  -  A7s4  -  |
Back beat, the word is on the street  [rhythm start]
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
About you now

| Cadd9              Ds4              Em7
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
| Cadd9        Ds4
There are many things that I
|     G       D      Em          G5         A7s4
would like to say to you / But I don't know how.

    | Cadd9  -  Em7  -  | G  -  Em7  -  |
    Because maybe
    You're gonna be the one that saves me
    And after all
    You're my wonderwall [strum off, 8 beats silence]

| Em7  -  G  -  | Ds4  -  A7s4  -  |
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should have somehow
Realised what you've gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
About you now

| Cadd9                Ds4                Em7
And all the roads that lead you there are winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
| Cadd9        Ds4
There are many things that I
|     G       D      Em          G5         A7s4
would like to say to you / But I don't know how.

    | Cadd9  -  Em7  -  | G  -  Em7  -  |
    Because maybe
    You're gonna be the one that saves me
    And after all
    You're my wonderwall

    Because maybe
    You're gonna be the one that saves me
    And after all
    You're my wonderwall
