Die Die Die (orig Capo 1)

G   %   Bm   C   /   G   Bm   Em   C
She's fighting with the sky / She thinks she can
Livin' within a lie / She thinks she can
G   Bm   Em   C
But nobody knows what lies behind
The days before the day we die
G   Em   Bm   ...   CM7
die die die...

G   %   Bm   C   /   G   Bm   Em   C
She puts her hands against / The life she had
Living with ignorance / Blissful and sad
G   Bm   Em   C
But nobody knows what lies behind
The days before the day we die
G   Em   Bm   ...   CM7
die die die...

G   Em7   Am7   D7   ...   CM7
You can try to swim the sea
But say goodbye to you and me

(INTERLUDE) 
Bm7   Am7   Bm7   Am7

G   Em7   Am7   D7   ...   CM7
You can try to swim the sea
You can try to hold the breeze
You can try to hide the sun
But say goodbye to everyone

G   Em7   Am7   D7   ...   CM7
You can try to swim the sea
You can try to hold the breeze
You can try through skin and bone
But you will end up all alone
