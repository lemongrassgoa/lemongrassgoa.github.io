Whitney Houston
I Wanna Dance With Somebody (orig. F#)

| F - - - | F - - - | Dm - - - | Bb - Gm-F/A-Bb-C | F

| C - - - | Dm - - Gm-F/A |
Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
| C - - - | Dm - - - |
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
| Gm - - - | C - - - | F/A - - - | Bb - - - |
I've done alright up 'till now
It's the light of day that shows me how
|   Gm       F     C/D               Bb - C
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

    | F - - - | F - - - | Dm - - - | Bb - - C7s4 |
    Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
    I wanna feel the heat with somebody
    Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
    With somebody who loves me
    | F - - - | F - - - | Dm - - - | Bb - Gm-F/A-Bb-C | F
    Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
    I wanna feel the heat with somebody
    Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
    With somebody who loves me

| C - - - | Dm - - Gm-F/A |
I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
| C - - - | Dm - - - |
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
| Gm - - - | C - - - | F/A - - - | Bb - - - |
I need a man who'll take the chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
|  Gm       F     C/D                    Bb - C
So when the night falls, my lonely heart calls

    | F - - - | F - - - | Dm - - - | Bb - - C7s4 |
    Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
    I wanna feel the heat with somebody
    Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
    With somebody who loves me
    | F - - - | F - - - | Dm - - - | Bb - Gm-F/A-Bb-C
    Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
    I wanna feel the heat ...
    Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
    With somebody who loves me

| Dm - - - | C - - Gm-C | Dm - - - | C - - - |
Somebody who, somebody who
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody who, somebody who
To hold me in his arms oh
| Gm - - - | C - - - | F/A - - - | Bb - - - |
I need a man who'll take the chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
|  Gm       F     C/D                    Bb - C
So when the night falls, my lonely heart calls

    | G - - - | G - - - | Em - - - | C - - D7s4 |
    Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
    I wanna feel the heat with somebody
    Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
    With somebody who loves me
    | G - - - | G - - - | Em - - - | C - Am-G/B-C-D
    Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
    I wanna feel the heat ...
    Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
    With somebody who loves me

| G - - - | G - - - | Em - - - | C - - D7s4 |
| G - - - | G - - - | Em - - - | C - Am-G/B-C-D
Ooh ooh (dance)
Come on baby (dance)
Ooh, yeah (dance)

Don'tcha wanna dance with me baby?
Don'tcha wanna dance with me boy?
