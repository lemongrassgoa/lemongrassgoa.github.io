Ave Maria (orig. C)

| G - - - | Cs2 - D - | Cs2 - - - | G - D - |
She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide.
I know the cost of a losing hand
Never thought the grace of God, oh I...

| Em7 - - - | D - - - | Cs2 - - - | Ds4
I found heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside...
| Em - - - | D - - - | G
Ave Maria

| G - - - | Cs2 - D - | Cs2 - - - | G - D - |
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

| Em7 - - - | D - - - | Cs2 - - - | Ds4
You are my heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside...
| Em - - - | D - - - | G
Singing Ave Maria

| Am - - - | Em - - - |
Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans.
Suddenly hits you, and then you realize
| D(s4)
It's out of your hands...
Baby, you've got to understand

| Em7 - - - | D - - - | Cs2 - - - | Ds4
You are my heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside...
| Em - - - | D - - - | G
