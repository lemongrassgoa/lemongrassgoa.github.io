Dolly Parton
Coat Of Many Colors (Capo 3)

[G] Back through the years I go wanderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my [C] youth
I [G] recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to [C] use

There were [G] rags of many colors / Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat / And it was [D] way down in the fall
Momma [G] sewed the rags together / Sewin' [C] every piece with love
She made my [G] coat of many colors / That [D] I was so proud [G] of

[G] As she sewed, she told a story / From the bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors / Joseph [D] wore and then she said
[G] "Perhaps this coat will bring you / Good [C] luck and happiness"
And I just [G] couldn't wait to wear it
And momma [D] blessed it with a [G] kiss

   My [C] coat of many colors / That my [G] momma made for me
   [C] Made only from rags / But I [G] wore it so [D] proudly
   [G] Although we had no money / I was [C] rich as I could be
   In my [G] coat of many colors / My [D] momma made for [G] me   [E7]
  
So with [A] patches on my britches / And holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors / I [E] hurried off to school
Just to [A] find the others laughing / And [D] making fun of me
In my [A] coat of many colors / My [E] momma made for [A] me

And oh I [A] couldn't understand it / For I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love / My momma [E] sewed in every stitch
And I [A] told 'em all the story / Momma [D] told me while she sewed
And how my [A] coat of many colors
Was worth [E] more than all their [A] clothes

   But they [D] didn't understand it / And I [A] tried to make them see
   That [D] one is only poor / Only [A] if they choose to [E] be
   Now I [A] know we had no money / But I was [D] rich as I could be
   In my [A] coat of many colors / My [E] momma made for [D] me
   Made just for [A] me
