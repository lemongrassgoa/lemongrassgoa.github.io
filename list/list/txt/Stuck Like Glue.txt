Stuck Like Glue

         G          D          C
VERSE 1: Absolutely no one that knows me better
         No one that can make me feel so good
         How did we stay so long together?
         When everybody, everybody said we never would
         And just when [Am] I, I start to think they're [C] right
         That [D] love has died...
         
LINK:    There you go making my heart beat again,
         Heart beat again, Heart beat again
         There you go making me feel like a kid
         Won't you do it and do it one time?
         There you go pulling me right back in,
         Right back in, Right back in
         And I [Am] know-oh I'm never letting this [C] go-oh [D]
         
REFRAIN: I'm stuck on you, woah-oh, woah-oh, stuck like glue
         You and me baby we're stuck like glue
         woah-oh, woah-oh, stuck like glue
         You and me baby we're stuck like glue
         
VERSE 2: Some days I don't feel like trying
         Some days you know I wanna just give up
         When it doesn't matter who's right
         Fight about it all night / Had enough
         You give me that look
         "I'm sorry baby let's make up"
         [Am] You do that thing that makes me [D] laugh
         And just like that...

         too stuck together from the ATL

         Just a spoon full of sugar make it better real quick, I say
         woah-oh, woah-oh, Whatcha gonna do with that?
         woah-oh, woah-oh, Come on over here with that
         Sugar sticky sweet stuff / Come on give me that stuff
         Everybody wants some / Melodies that get stuck
