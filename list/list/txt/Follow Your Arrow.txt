INTRO:   F    Dm

         F    Dm    Bb    Gm  C
VERSE 1: If you save yourself for marriage / You're a bore
         If you don't save yourself for marriage / You're a hor-rible person
         If you won't have a drink / Then you're a prude
         But they'll call you a drunk / As soon as you down the first one
         
         F    Dm    Bb    Gm  C
VERSE 2: If you can't lose the weight / Then you're just fat
         But if you lose too much / Then you're on crack
         You're damned if you do / And you're damned if you don't
         So you might as well just do / Whatever you want / So
         
         F                    Dm
REFRAIN: Make lots of noise / Kiss lots of boys
         F                              Gm               C
         Or kiss lots of girls / If that's something you're into
         F                                     Dm
         When the straight and narrow / Gets a little too straight
                 Bb
         Roll up a joint (or don't)
             F                       C       F       (Am)
         Just follow your arrow / Wherever it points, yeah
         F                       C       F
         Follow your arrow / Wherever it points
         
         F    Dm    Bb    Gm  C
VERSE 3: If you don't go to church / You'll go to hell
         If you're the first one / On the front row
         You're self-righteous / Son of a-
         Can't win for losing / You'll just disappoint 'em
         Just 'cause you can't beat 'em / Don't mean you should join 'em

         F                    Dm
BRIDGE:  Say what you think / Love who you love
         'Cause you just get / So many trips 'round the sun
         Yeah, you [Gm7] only / Only live [F] once (intro theme)
