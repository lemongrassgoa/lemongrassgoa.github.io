Robbie Williams
Angels [drum: Groove Beat 1, bpm: 80]

| D     %     G     A
I sit and wait / Does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know / The places where we go / When we're grey and old
| Em7   G     Bm    G
'cause I've been told / That salvation lets their wings unfold
| C     G/B   D/A
So when I'm lying in my bed / Thoughts running through my head
And I feel that love is dead / I'm loving angels instead
|                             C           G        D

|   A    Bm    G    D
    And through it all / she offers me protection
    A lot of love and affection / Whether I'm right or wrong
    And down the waterfall / Wherever it may take me
    I know that life won't break me / When I come to call
|                Em       C           G/B      D
    She won't forsake me / I'm loving angels instead

| D     %     G     A
When I'm feeling weak / And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above / And I know I'll always be blessed with love
| C     G/B   D/A
And as the feeling grows / She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead / I'm loving angels instead
|                      C           G        D

|   A    Bm    G    D
    And through it all / she offers me protection
    A lot of love and affection / Whether I'm right or wrong
    And down the waterfall / Wherever it may take me
    I know that life won't break me / When I come to call
|                Em       C           G/B      D
    She won't forsake me / I'm loving angels instead

|   A    Bm    G    D
    And through it all / she offers me protection
    A lot of love and affection / Whether I'm right or wrong
    And down the waterfall / Wherever it may take me
    I know that life won't break me / When I come to call
|                Em       C           G/B      D
    She won't forsake me / I'm loving angels instead
