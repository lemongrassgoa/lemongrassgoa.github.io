| Bm7     G     D     Dsus2
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
you don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
tell you I'll set you apart
tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
oh lets go back to the start
running in circles, coming up tails
heads on a science apart

    | G          D    Dsus2
    Nobody said it was easy
    it's such a shame for us to part
    nobody said it was easy
    no-one ever said it would be this [A] hard
    | A7                       (D)
    oh take me back to the start

| D     G     D     Dsus2
| Bm7   G     D     Dsus2

[rhythm start]
| Bm7     G     D     Dsus2
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
pulling the puzzles apart
questions of science, science and progress
do not speak as loud as my heart
tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
oh and I rush to the start
running in circles, chasing tales, coming back as we are

    | G          D    Dsus2
    Nobody said it was easy
    it's such a shame for us to part
    nobody said it was easy
    no-one ever said it would be so [A] hard
    | A7                       (D)
    I'm goin' back to the start

| D     G     D     Dsus2
| Bm7   G     D     Dsus2
      
       | Bm7    G            D    |
