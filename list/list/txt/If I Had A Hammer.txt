If I Had A Hammer

If I had a hammer                     |  G    Bm   C   D
I'd hammer in the morning             |  G    Bm   C   D
I'd hammer in the evening             |  G    Bm   C   %
All over this land                    |  D    %    %   %
                                      |  
    And I'd hammer out danger         |  G    %    %   %
    I'd hammer out a warning          |  Em   %    %   %
    I'd hammer out love between       |  C    G
    my brothers and my sisters        |  C    G
    All over this land                |  C    G    D   %

If I had a bell
I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land

    I'd ring out danger
    I'd ring out a warning
    I'd ring out love between
    my brothers and my sisters
    All over this land, ooh

If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening
All over this land

    I'd sing out danger
    I'd sing out a warning
    I'd sing out love between
    my brothers and my sisters
    All over this land, ooh

Well I got a hammer
And I got a bell
And I got a song to sing
All over this land

    It's the hammer of Justice
    It's the bell of Freedom
    It's the song about Love between
    my brothers and my sisters
    All over this land

    It's the hammer of Justice
    It's the bell of Freedom
    It's the song about Love between
    my brothers and my sisters
    All over this land
