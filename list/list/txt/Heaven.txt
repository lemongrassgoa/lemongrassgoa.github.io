| C     Am                     G
  Oh,   thinkin' about all our younger years
|         Dm           Am           Bb                 G
There was only you and me / We were young and wild and free
| C     Am                    G
  Now   nothin' can take you away from me
|          Dm               Am
We've been down that road before
|         Bb       /A             G
But that's over now / You keep me comin' back for more

    | F            G          Am                 C                F
      Baby, you're all that I want / When you're lyin' here in my arms
    |   F          G         Am               G
    I'm findin' it hard to believe / We're in heaven
    |   F       G          Am           C                      F
    And love is all that I need / And I found it there in your heart
    |  F         G       Am             G
    It isn't too hard to see / We're in heaven

| C    Am                    G
  Oh,  once in your life you find someone
|        Dm              Am                 Bb                     G
Who will turn your world around / Bring you up when you're feelin' down
| C     Am                            G
  Yeah, nothin' could change what you mean to me
|           Dm                Am
Oh, there's lots that I could say
|        Bb        /A             G
But just hold me now / 'Cause our love will light the way

    | F            G          Am                 C                F
      Baby, you're all that I want / When you're lyin' here in my arms
    |   F          G         Am               G
    I'm findin' it hard to believe / We're in heaven
    |   F       G          Am           C                      F
    And love is all that I need / And I found it there in your heart
    |  F         G       Am             G       (hold for 1 bar)
    It isn't too hard to see / We're in heaven  

| Dm                 C/E     F
   I've been waitin' for so  long
|     F         G    Am                      G/B ..... C
  For somethin' to arrive / For love to come along
| Dm                 C/E     F
   Now our dreams are comin' true
|             F                  C
  Through the good times and the bad
|               G
  Yeah, I'll be standin' there by you

    | F            G          Am                 C                F

    |   F          G         Am               G
    I'm findin' it hard to believe / We're in heaven
    |   F       G          Am           C                      F

    It isn't too hard to see / We're in heaven
