Love Story (orig. D)

INTRO: | D          A           Bm          G

| D         G           Bm          G
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there / On a balcony in summer air
| D         G           Bm          A(s4)
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello." / Little did I know

| G - - - | A - - - | Bm - - - | D - - - |
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
| G - - - | A - - - | Bm - - - | G - A - |
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go." / And I said

[D]  "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
[A]  I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
[Bm] You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[G]  It's a love story [A] baby, just say Yes"  [D]

| D         G           Bm          G
So, I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So, close your eyes / Escape this town for a little while

| G - - - | A - - - | Bm - - - | D - - - |
'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
| G - - - | A - - - | Bm - - - | G - A - |
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go!" / And I said

[D]  "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
[A]  I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
[Bm] You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[G]  It's a love story [A] baby, just say Yes

[D]  Romeo, save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel
[A]  This love is difficult but it's real
[Bm] Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
[G]  It's a love story [A] baby, just say Yes"  [D]

(instrumental)
| D         A           Bm          G     A

| Bm - - - | G - - - | D - - - | A - - - |
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

     (quietly)
[D]  "Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone
[A]  I keep waiting for you, but you never come
[Bm] Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
[G]  He knelt to the ground and pulled out a [A] ring and said

      (key change)
[E]   "Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone
[B]   I love you, and that's all I really know
[C#m] I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
[A]   It's a love story [B] baby, just say ... Yes"

| E         B           C#m         A

... 'Cause we were both young when I first saw [E] you
