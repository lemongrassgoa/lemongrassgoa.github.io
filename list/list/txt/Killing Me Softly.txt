Killing Me Softly With His Song (orig Capo 1)

INTRO: | Em    Dm7   G(7)(sus4)   C   (/B)
       | Am    D     G            B7

    | Em    C     D       G
    Strumming my pain with his fingers
    Singing my life with his words
    | Em    A     D       C
    Killing me softly with his song
    Killing me softly / with his song
    | G     C     Fmaj7   E
    Telling my whole life / with his words
    Killing me softly / with his song

| Am    D     G     C   (/B)
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
| Am     D     Em
And so I came to see him
and listen for a while
| Am    D     G     B7
And there he was, this young boy
a stranger to my eyes ...

    | Em    C     D       G
    Strumming my pain with his fingers
    Singing my life with his words
    | Em    A     D       C
    Killing me softly with his song
    Killing me softly / with his song
    | G     C     Fmaj7   E
    Telling my whole life / with his words
    Killing me softly / with his song

| Am    D     G     C   (/B)
I felt all flushed with fever
embarrassed by the crowd
| Am    D     Em
I felt he found my letters
and read each one out loud
| Am    D     G     B7
I prayed that he would finish
but he just kept right on ...

    | Em    C     D       G
    Strumming my pain with his fingers
    Singing my life with his words
    | Em    A     D       C
    Killing me softly with his song
    Killing me softly / with his song
    | G     C     Fmaj7   E
    Telling my whole life / with his words
    Killing me softly / with his song


INTERLUDE:  Am    F    G    C
            Am    D    G    E7

| Am    D     G     C   (/B)
He sang as if knew me
in all my dark despair
| Am    D     Em
And then he looked right through me
as if I wasn't there
| Am    D     G     B7
And he just kept on singing
singing clear and strong ...

    | Em    C     D       G
    Strumming my pain with his fingers
    Singing my life with his words
    | Em    A     D       C
    Killing me softly with his song
    Killing me softly / with his song
    | G     C     Fmaj7   E
    Telling my whole life / with his words
    Killing me softly / with his song
