Delilah

[Verse 1]
Am                                                E7
I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window
Am                                          E7
I saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind
A*  A7*    Dm
She was my woman
Am                   E7                          Am    G7
As she deceived me I watched, and went out of my mind
 
[Chorus]
C             G
My, my, my, Delilah
G              B C
Why, why, why, Delilah
C       C7       F                    Dm
I could see that girl was no good for me
C                     G                       C    E7
But I was lost like a slave that no man could free
 
[Verse 2]
Am                                             E7
At break of day when that man drove away I was waiting
Am                                                   E7
I crossed the street to her house and she opened the door
A   A7          Dm
She stood there laughing
Am                     E7   N.C.                Am     G7
I felt the knife in my hand, and she laughed no more
 
[Chorus]
C             G
My, my, my, Delilah
G              B C
Why, why, why, Delilah
C    C7        F                      Dm
So before they come to break down the door
C                      G                      C      E7
Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take any more
 
[Break]
Am E7
Am E7
 
[Verse Reprise]
A   A7          Dm
She stood there laughing
Am                     E7  N.C.                 Am     G7
I felt the knife in my hand, and she laughed no more
 
[Chorus]
C             G
My, my, my, Delilah
G              B C
Why, why, why, Delilah
C    C7        F                      Dm
So before they come to break down the door
C                      G                      C
Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take any more
Am                     E7                     Am  Dm  Am     E7 Am
Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take any mo--oo--ore
