Hey, Soul Sister Capo 4 [rhythm: Groove 1, bpm: 110]

    Hey-ay, Hey-ay-AY-ay-ay, Hey-ay-AY-ay-ay

Your lipstick stains / on the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you, and so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam / the smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

    Hey soul sister ain't that mister mister on the radio stereo
    The way you move ain't fair you know
    Hey soul sister I don't want to miss a single thing you do ...
    tonight

Just in time / I'm so glad you have a one track mind like me
You gave my love direction, a game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed / my heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna
and I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

    Hey soul sister ain't that mister mister on the radio stereo
    The way you move ain't fair you know
    Hey soul sister I don't want to miss a single thing you do ...
    tonight

The way you can cut a rug / Watching you's the only drug I need
You're so gangster I'm so thug / You're the only one I'm dreaming of you see
I can be myself now finally / In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be with me

    Hey soul sister ain't that mister mister on the radio stereo
    The way you move ain't fair you know
    Hey soul sister I don't want to miss a single thing you do tonight
    Hey soul sister I don't want to miss a single thing you do ...
    tonight
