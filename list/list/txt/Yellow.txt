VERSE 1: Look at the stars / Look how they shine for you
         And all the things you do / yeah, they were all yellow
         I came along / I wrote a song for you
         And all the things you do / And it was called 'Yellow'
         So then I took my turn / Oh what a thing to have done
         And it was all yellow.
