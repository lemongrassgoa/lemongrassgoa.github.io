Bobby Darin
Dream Lover (orig. C)

Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms

    'Cause I want (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    A girl (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    To call (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    My own (yeah-yeah)
    I want a dream lover
    So, I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover, where are you?
With a love, oh, so true
And the hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old

    'Cause I want (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    A girl (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    To call (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    My own (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    I want a dream lover
    So, I don't have to dream alone

  (BRIDGE)
  Someday, I don't know how
  I hope she'll hear my pleas
  Some way, I don't know how
  She'll bring her love to me

Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
'Til all my lover's dreams come true

    'Cause I want (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    A girl (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    To call (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    My own (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    I want a dream lover
    So, I don't have to dream alone [key change]

Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
'Til all my lover's dreams come true

    'Cause I want (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    A girl (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    To call (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    My own (yeah-yeah, yeah)
    I want a dream lover
    So, I don't have to dream alone

Please, don't make me dream alone
I beg you, don't make me dream alone
No, I don't wanna dream alone
