Ten Years After
I'd Love To Change The World

Everywhere is / freaks and hairies 
Dykes and fairies / tell me where is sanity
Tax the rich / feed the poor 
'Til there are no / rich no more 

    I'd love to change the world
    But I don't know what to do
    So I'll leave it up to you

Population / keeps on breeding
Nation bleeding / still more feeding economy
Life is funny / skies are sunny
Bees make honey, who needs money, No none for me

    I'd love to change the world
    But I don't know what to do
    So I'll leave it up to you
        
... Oh yeah!
(instrumental)
         
World pollution / there's no solution
Institution / electrocution
Just black and white / rich or poor
Senators / stop the war

    I'd love to change the world
    But I don't know what to do
    So I'll leave it up to you
