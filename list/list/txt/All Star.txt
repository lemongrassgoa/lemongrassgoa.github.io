| D      A      Em     G
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

| D      A      Em     G
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun / Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see / So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go / You'll never shine if you don't glow

|   D     G     E7/G#     G
    Hey now, you're an All Star / get your game on, go play
    Hey now, you're a Rock Star / get the show on, get paid
    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shooting [D]stars [C]break the [G]mould

| D      A      Em     G
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
But the media men beg to differ / Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours? / That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

|   D     G     E7/G#     G
    Hey now, you're an All Star / get your game on, go play
    Hey now, you're a Rock Star / get the show on, get paid
    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shooting [D]stars [C]break the [G]mould

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept / I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

All Star (Capo 4)


Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

We got the afternoon / You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do / Discover me, Discovering you

One mile to every inch of / Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and / Your bubblegum tongue

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun / Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see / So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go / You'll never shine if you don't glow

    D     G     E7/G#     G
    Hey now, you're an All Star / get your game on, go play
    Hey now, you're a Rock Star / get the show on, get paid
    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shooting [D]stars [C]break the [G]mould

Em     A
And if you want love / We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea / Of blankets
Take all your big plans / And break 'em
Em     F#m     G     A
This is bound to be a while

    D      A      Em     G
    Your body is a wonderland
    Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
    Your body Is a wonderland

D      A      Em     G

But the media men beg to differ / Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours? / That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

    Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face
    I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
    You tell me where to go and / Though I might leave to find it
    I'll never let your head hit the bed / Without my hand behind it

Em     A
You want love? / We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea / Of blankets
Take all your big plans / And break 'em
Em     F#m     G     A
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body Is a wonderland
