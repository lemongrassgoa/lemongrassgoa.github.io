| G    Dm     Dm    Am
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

| G    Dm     Dm    Am
Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

| G    Dm     Dm    Am
    You ... are ...
    You ... are ...

| G    Dm     Dm    Am
Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks 
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

| G    Dm     Dm    Am
Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities 
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

|   G    Dm     Dm    Am
    You ... are ...
    You ... are ...

| BbM7           F    C
And nothing else compares
Oh  nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

| BbM7 ...

(soft strum)
| G    Dm     Dm    Am

|   G    Dm     Dm    Am
    You ... are ...
    You ... are ...

| G    Dm     Dm    Am
Home, home where I wanted to go 
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
