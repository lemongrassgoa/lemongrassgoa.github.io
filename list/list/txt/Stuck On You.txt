Stuck On You (orig. F) (capo 2)

| G - - - | Bm7 - - - | C - - - | D7s4 - - - |
Stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep
in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way

Needed a friend
And the way I feel now I guess
I'll be with you 'til the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed (riff)

| G - - - | Bm7 - - - | C - - - | D7s4 - - - |
I'm stuck on you
Been a fool too long I guess it's
time for me to come on home
Guess I'm on my way

So hard to see
That a woman like you could
wait around for a man like me
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed (riff)

    | C - - - | D7s4 - - - | G - - - | Em
    Oh, I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow
    | C - - - | D7s4 - - - | G - D/F#-Em-D/F#-G
    And I know just where I'm going
    | C - - - | D7s4 - - - | G - D/F# - | Em
    I've packed up my troubles and
    | D Em - - | D Em - - |
    I've thrown them all away ...
    'Cause this time little darling
    | C - - - | - - D - |
    I'm coming home to stay

| G - - - | Bm7 - - - | C - - - | D7s4 - - - |
I'm stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep
in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way

Needed a friend
And the way I feel now I guess
I'll be with you 'til the end
Guess I'm on my way ... (pause)
I'm mighty glad you stayed (riff)
