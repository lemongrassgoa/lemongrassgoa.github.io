Just The Two Of Us
Bill Withers

| CM7     B7     Em7  -  Dm7   G7
I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you sometime
And I want to spend some time with you

| CM7     B7     Em7 - (Ebm7) - Dm7 - G7
REFRAIN: Just the two of us
         We can make it if we try
         Just the two of us
         (Just the two of us)
         Just the two of us
         Building castles in the sky
         Just the two of us
         You and I

| CM7     B7     Em7  -  Dm7   G7
We look for love no time for tears
Wasted water's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not for those who wait too late
We gotta go for all we know

| CM7     B7     Em7 - (Ebm7) - Dm7 - G7
REFRAIN: Just the two of us
         We can make it if we try
         Just the two of us
         (Just the two of us)
         Just the two of us
         Building castles in the sky
         Just the two of us
         You and I

| CM7     B7     Em7  -  Dm7   G7
I hear the crystal raindrops fall
On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
And darling when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you

| CM7     B7     Em7 - (Ebm7) - Dm7 - G7
REFRAIN: Just the two of us
         We can make it if we try
         Just the two of us
         (Just the two of us)
         Just the two of us
         Building castles in the sky
         Just the two of us
         You and I
