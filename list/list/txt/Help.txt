Help!

[Intro]
 
Bm               Bm/A    G                 G/F#
Help! I need somebody,   Help! Not just anybody
E                              A
Help! You know I need someone, Help!
 
A                            C#m               F#m
When I was younger, so much younger than today,
                          D       G   A
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
                                C#m                 F#m
But now those days are gone I'm not so self-assured,
                                        D    G       A
Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors.
 
 
     Bm                                 Bm/A    G                            G/F#
    Help me if you can I'm feeling down, and I do appreciate you being 'round.
     E                                                  A
    Help me get my feet back on the ground, won't you please please help me.
 
 
[Verse]
 
                              C#m                   F#m
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
                           D     G       A
My independence seemed to vanish in the haze.
                         C#m                 F#m
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
                                        D    G     A
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 Bm                                 Bm/A    G                            G/F#
Help me if you can I'm feeling down, and I do appreciate you being 'round.
 E                                                 A
Help me get my feet back on the ground, won't you please please help me.
