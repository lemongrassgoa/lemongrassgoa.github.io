John Denver
Perhaps Love

         D   Bm   Em   A
VERSE 1: Perhaps love is like a resting place / A shelter from the storm
         It exists to give you comfort / It is there to keep you warm
         F#m  Bm   G   A  /  Em   A   D
         And in those times of trouble / When you are most alone
         The memory of love will bring you home [A]
 
         D   Bm   Em   A
VERSE 2: Perhaps love is like a window / Perhaps an open door
         It invites you to come closer / It wants to show you more
         F#m  Bm   G   A  /  Em   A   D
         And even if you lose yourself / And don't know what to do
         The memory of love will see you through

         F#m  Bm   /   G  A  D
BRIDGE:  Oh Love to some is like a cloud / To some as strong as steel
         For some a way of living / For some a way to feel
         And some say love is holding on / And some say letting go
         And some say love is everything / [Em] Some say they don't [A]know
 
         D   Bm   Em   A
VERSE 3: Perhaps love is like the ocean / Full of conflict, full of pain
         Like a fire when it's cold outside / Or thunder when it rains
         F#m  Bm   G   A  /  Em   A   D
         If I should live forever / And all my dreams come true
         My memories of love will be of you

(BRIDGE) (instrumental / vocal)
