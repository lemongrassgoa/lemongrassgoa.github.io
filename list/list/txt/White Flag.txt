White Flag
Dido (orig. Dm) [rhythm: Groove 1, bpm: 85]

INTRO: | F - - - | F - - - | Am - - - | Am - - - |

| Dm                Am
I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
Or tell you that.
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it
Where's the sense in that?
| C                Gm
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were  [Am]

    | Bb     F     Gm7     Dm
    But I will go down with this ship
    And I won't put my hands up and surrender
    There will be no white flag above my door
    I'm in love and always will be

| Dm                Am
I know I left too much mess and destruction
To come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again
| C                Gm
And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
Then I'm sure that that makes sense [Am]

    | Bb     F     Gm7     Dm
    But I will go down with this ship
    And I won't put my hands up and surrender
    There will be no white flag above my door
    I'm in love and always will be

[F]    And when we meet / Which I'm sure we will
[Am7]  All that was there / Will be there still
[Gm7]  I'll let it pass / And hold my tongue
[C7s4] And you will think / That I've moved on....

    | Bb     F     Gm7     Dm
    But I will go down with this ship
    And I won't put my hands up and surrender
    There will be no white flag above my door
    I'm in love and always will be
    
    | Bb     F     Gm7     Dm
    But I will go down with this ship
    And I won't put my hands up and surrender
    There will be no white flag above my door
    I'm in love and always will be
    
    [single strums]
    | Bb     F     Gm7     Dm
    But I will go down with this ship
    And I won't put my hands up and surrender
    There will be no white flag above my door
    I'm in love and always will be
