Dolly Parton (Randy VanWarmer)
Just When I Needed You Most

VERSE 1: You packed in the morning / I stared out the window
         And I struggled for something to say
         You left in the rain without closing the door
         I didn't stand in your way
LINK 1:  Now I miss you more than I / missed you before
         And now where I'll find comfort, God knows

REFRAIN: 'Cause you left me / Just when I needed you most   |  x2

VERSE 2: Now most every morning / I stare out the window
         I think about where you might be
         I've written you letters that I'd like to send
         If you would just send one to me
LINK 2:  'Cause I need you more / Than I needed before
         And now where I'll find comfort, God knows

(VERSE 1)

LINK 3:  Now I love you more than I / loved you before
         And now where I'll find comfort, God knows
