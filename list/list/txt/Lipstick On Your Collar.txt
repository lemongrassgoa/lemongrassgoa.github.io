Lipstick On Your Collar (orig. G)

G                Em        Am            D      
When you left me all alone at the record hop
Told me you were goin' out for a soda pop
G                 G7             C
You were gone for quite a while, half an hour or more
A                              D
You came back and man, oh man, this is what I saw

    G                       C
    Lipstick on your collar told a tale on you
    Lipstick on your collar said you were untrue
    G               B7      Em            B7
    Bet your bottom dollar, you and I are through
           C                G      D              G
    'Cause lipstick on your collar told a tale on you, yeah
    
(INSTRUMENTAL refrain)

G           Em              Am               D      
You said it belonged to me, made me stop and think
And then I noticed yours was red, mine was baby pink
G                 G7         C 
Who walked in but Mary Jane, lipstick all a mess
A                                  D 
Were you smoochin' my best friend? Guess the answer's yes

    G                       C
    Lipstick on your collar told a tale on you
    Lipstick on your collar said you were untrue
    G               B7      Em            B7
    Bet your bottom dollar, you and I are through
           C                G      D              G
    'Cause lipstick on your collar told a tale on you, boy
                                   Told a tale on you, man
                                   Told a tale on you, yeah
                                   Told a tale on you
