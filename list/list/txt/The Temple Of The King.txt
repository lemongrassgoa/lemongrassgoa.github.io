INTRO: | Am - - - | F - - - | G  - - - | Am - - - |
       | Am - - - | G - - - | Dm - F - | Am - - - | 

| C - G - | Dm - Am - |
One day in the year of the fox
Came a time remembered well
| F - G - | Am - - - | 
When the strong young man of the rising sun
Heard the tolling of the great black bell

| C - G - | E7 - Am - |
One day in the year of the fox
When the bell began to ring
| F - G - | Am - - - | 
Meant the time had come for one to go
To the temple of the king

    | Dm - - - | Am - - - |
    There in the middle of the circle he stands
    Searching, seeking
    | G - Dm - | Am - - - |
    With just one touch of his trembling hand
    The answer will be found

    | Dm - - - | Am - - - |
    Daylight waits while the old man sings
    "Heaven, help me"
    | G - - - | E7 - - - |
    And then like the rush of a thousand wings
    It shines upon the one
    And the [F] day had [G] just [Am] begun

RIFF: | Am - - - | F - - - | G  - - - | Am - - - |
      | Am - - - | G - - - | Dm - F - | Am - - - | 

| C - G - | Dm - Am - |
One day in the year of the fox
Came a time remembered well
| F - G - | Am - - - | 
When the strong young man of the rising sun
Heard the tolling of the great black bell

| C - G - | E7 - Am - |
One day in the year of the fox
When the bell began to sing
| F - G - | Am - - - | 
It meant the time had come for the one to go
To the temple of the king

| Dm - - - | Am - - - |
There in the middle of the people he stands
Seeing, feeling
| G - - - | E7 - - - |
With just a wave of a strong right hand he's gone
To the [F] temple [G] of the [Am] king

RIFF: | Am - - - | F - - - | G  - - - | Am - - - |
      | Am - - - | G - - - | Dm - F - | E7 - - - | 

SOLO: | Am - - - | F - - - | Am - - - | F  - - - 
      | Am - - - | G - - - | Dm - - - | E7 - - - |      x2

| Dm - - - | Am - - - |
Far from the circle at the edge of the world
He's hoping, wondering
| F - G - | Am - - - | 
Thinking back from the stories he's heard
Of what he's gonna see

| Dm - - - | Am - - - |
There in middle of the circle it lies
Heaven, help me
| G - - - | E7 - - - |
Then all could see by the shine in his eyes
The answer had been found

| Dm - - - | Am - - - |
Back with the people in the circle he stands
Giving, feeling
| G - - - | E7 - - - |
With just one touch of a strong right hand, they know
Of the [F] temple [G] and the [Am] king

RIFF: | Am - - - | F - - - | G  - - - | Am - - - |
      | Am - - - | G - - - | Dm - F - | Am - - - |
