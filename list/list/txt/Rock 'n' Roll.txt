Eric Hutchinson (orig Bb)  Capo 3 G [rhythm: 16th Shuffle 1, bpm: 100]

         G    B7    C    A7
VERSE 1: He's been / waiting around for the weekend
         Figuring which club to sneak in
         Fancy drinks and fifty-dollar cover charge
         Lately it's been a big hassle / Heineken and New Castle
         To make sure he's fitting in and living large
         Bm7    Am7    C    D
         Disregard / the lies that he will tell 
         And what he's probably like 'cause
         It's not hard / his charm is gonna
         Get him through the night
         
         C    G    D    G
REFRAIN: If he wanna rock he rocks / If he wanna roll he rolls
1) he    He can roll with the punches
2) she   Long as he feels like he's in control
3) they  If he wanna stay he stays / If he wanna go he goes
         He doesn't care how he gets there
         Long as he gets somewhere he knows oh no 
         Ah na na na na na na na na na na na    x2
         
         G    B7    C    A7
VERSE 2: See her / heavy make up and cut t-shirt
         Every girl out wants to be her
         But they look the same already why adjust
         Reading the magazine secrets / Forgettin' the topical regrets
         'Cause If she comes home all alone the nights a bust
         Bm7    Am7    C    D
         It's a must / the swivel in her hips
         And the look she gives
         It's all her trust / if only in the morning
         She knew where she lived
         
(REFRAIN)
         
         Am   F   G   C
         And in a wink they're on the brink
         From drink to drink and at the bar With cash to blow
         From shot to shot it's getting hot
         Advance the plot to see how far It's gonna go
         All depends so ditch the friends And grab a cab
         Another chance for cheap romance
         Doesn't count cause the room is spinning
         Nothing to lose [Bm7] tonight they both [Bbm7] are [Am7] winning
         And they [C] fall in love as they [D] fall in bed
         They sing
