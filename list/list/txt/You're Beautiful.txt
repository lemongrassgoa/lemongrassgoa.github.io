| D       A/C#       Bm7       (G5)
My life is brilliant / My love is pure
I saw an angel / Of that I'm sure.
She smiled at me on the subway / She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that / 'Cause I've got a plan

    | G          A   D
    You're beautiful / You're beautiful.
    | G          A          D
    You're beautiful / it's true.
    | G        A         D   F#m7 Bm(7)
    I saw your face in a crowded  place,
    |     G          A/C#    Bm(7)
    And I don't know what to do
    |           G     A       D   (intro riff)
    'Cause I'll never be with you. 

| D       A/C#       Bm7       (G5)
Yeah, she caught my eye / As we walked on by.
She could see from my face that I was / Fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

    | G          A   D
    You're beautiful / You're beautiful.
    | G          A          D
    You're beautiful / it's true.
    | G        A         D   F#m7 Bm(7)
    I saw your face in a crowded  place,
    |     G          A/C#    Bm(7)
    And I don't know what to do
    |           G     A       D
    'Cause I'll never be with you.

    There must be an angel with a smile on her  face
    |        G5                       A           D  D/C#  Bm7 
    When she thought up that I should be with you
    |        G5      A/C#     Bm(7)          G     A/C#    D
    But it's time to face the truth / I will never be with you.
