Zombie
The Cranberries

VERSE 1: Another head hangs lowly
         Child is slowly taken
         And the violence caused such silence
         Who are we mistaken
         But you see it's not me
         It's not my family
         In your head, in your head
         they are fighting
         With their tanks and their bombs
         And their bombs and their guns
         In your head, in your head
         they are cryin'

REFRAIN: In your head, in your head
         Zombie, zombie, zombie
         What's in your head, in your head
         Zombie, zombie, zombie

VERSE 2: Another mother's breakin'
         Heart is taking over
         When the violence causes silence
         We must be mistaken
         It's the same old theme
         since nineteen-sixteen
         In your head, in your head
         they're still fightin'
         With their tanks and their bombs
         And their bombs and their guns
         In your head, in your head
         they are dyin'
