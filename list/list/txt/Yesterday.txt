Yesterday
The Beatles

F        Em7      A7                 Dm        C
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Bb     C7                      F           /E
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
C   Dm  G7       Bb    F
Oh, I believe in yesterday

F        Em7      A7             Dm        C
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
Bb        C7             F         /E
There's a shadow hanging over me.

Oh, yesterday came suddenly

    Em7  A7   Dm   C   Bb  Bb/A    Gm7      C7       F
    Why  she  had  to  go  I don't know she wouldn't say
    Em7  A7   Dm   C     Bb     Bb/A  Gm7      C     F
    I    said some thing wrong, now I long for yesterday

F        Em7        A7           Dm          C7
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Bb    C7              F           /E
Now I need a place to hide away
C   Dm  G7       Bb    F
Oh, I believe in yesterday

    Em7  A7   Dm   C   Bb  Bb/A    Gm7      C7       F
    Why  she  had  to  go  I don't know she wouldn't say
    Em7  A7   Dm   C     Bb     Bb/A  Gm7      C     F
    I    said some thing wrong, now I long for yesterday

F        Em7        A7           Dm          C7
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play

Now I need a place to hide away
