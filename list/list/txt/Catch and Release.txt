Catch & Release
Matt Simons , Julien Mueller (orig A)

INTRO:   A    F#m7    C#m7

A    F#m    C#m7
There's a place I go to / Where no one knows me
It's not lonely / It's a necessary thing
It's a place I made up / Find out what I'm made of
The nights I've stayed up / Counting stars and fighting sleep

    A    Bm    C#m    D(M7)
    Let it wash over me / I'm ready to lose my feet
    Take me off to the place where one reveals life's mystery
    Steady on down the line / Lose every sense of time
    Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
    Day to day I'm blind to see
    And find how far / To go

A    F#m    C#m    D
Everybody got their reason / Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing / What builds up throughout the day
It gets into your body / It flows right through your blood
We can tell each other secrets / And remember how to love

INTERLUDE:  A    F#m7    C#m7

A    F#m    C#m7
There's a place I'm going / Where no one knows me
If I breathe real slowly / Let it out and let it in
It can be terrifying / To be slowly dying
Also clarifying / We end where we begin

    A    Bm    C#m    D(M7)
    Let it wash over me / I'm ready to lose my feet
    Take me off to the place where one reveals life's mystery
    Steady on down the line / Lose every sense of time
    Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
    Day to day I'm blind to see
    And find how far / To go

A    F#m    C#m    D
Everybody got their reason / Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing / What builds up throughout the day
It gets into your body / It flows right through your blood
We can tell each other secrets / And remember how to love

INTERLUDE:  A    F#m7    C#m7

A    F#m    C#m    D
Everybody got their reason / Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing / What builds up throughout the day
It gets into your body / It flows right through your blood
We can tell each other secrets / And remember how to love
