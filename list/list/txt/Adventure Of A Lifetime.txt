Adventure Of A Lifetime
Coldplay (orig. Am) [rhythm: Groove 1, BPM: 106]

(riff)

Turn your magic on / To me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends every day / That's what she told me
Turn your magic on / To me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight / We are diamonds

    Now I feel my heart beating
    I feel my heart underneath my skin
    And I feel my heart beating [guitar beat]
    Oh, you make me feel ...
    
    Like I'm alive again / Alive again
    Oh, you make me feel / Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on / Not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say / Only I own me

    Now I feel my heart beating
    I feel my heart underneath my skin
    And I feel my heart beating [guitar beat]
    'Cause you make me feel ...
    
    Like I'm alive again / Alive again
    Oh, you make me feel / Like I'm alive again

[single strums]
Turn your magic on / To me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape [rhythm]

    (woo-hoo / woo-hoo)

    If we've only got this life / This adventure, oh, then I
    And if we've only got this life / You get me through, oh

    If we've only got this life / And this adventure, oh, then I
    Want to share it with you / With you / With you / Sing it out!

    Woo hoo (woo hoo) / Woo hoo (woo hoo) / Woo hoo (woo hoo)  | x3
