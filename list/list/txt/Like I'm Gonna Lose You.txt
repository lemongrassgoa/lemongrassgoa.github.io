Like I'm Gonna Lose You
Meghan Trainor

| C       Em7/B       Am        F - Em - Dm7 - G7s4
I found myself dreaming / in silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie / That every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight / And you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared / And then I was all alone

| C       Em7/B       Am        F - C - Dm7 - G7s4
I woke up in tears / With you by my side
A breath of relief / And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

    | C       Em7/B       Am        F(s2)     G7s4
    So I'm gonna love you / Like I'm gonna lose you
    I'm gonna hold you / Like I'm saying goodbye
    Wherever we're standing / I won't take you for granted
    'cause we'll never know when / When we'll run out of time
    So I'm gonna love you / Like I'm gonna lose you
    I'm gonna love you / Like I'm gonna lose you

| C       Em7/B       Am        F - Em - Dm7 - G7s4
In the blink of an eye / Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything / The truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer, baby / Any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes / And love with no regrets

| C       Em7/B       Am        F - C - Dm7 - G7s4
Let's take our time / To say what we want
Use what we got / Before it's all gone
'Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow

    | C       Em7/B       Am        F(s2)     G7s4
    So I'm gonna love you / Like I'm gonna lose you
    I'm gonna hold you / Like I'm saying goodbye
    Wherever we're standing / I won't take you for granted
    'cause we'll never know when / When we'll run out of time
    So I'm gonna love you / Like I'm gonna lose you
    I'm gonna love you / Like I'm gonna lose you

| C       Em7/B       Am        F(s2)     G7s4
So I'm gonna love you / Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you / Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing / I won't take you for granted
'cause we'll never know when / When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you / Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you / Like I'm gonna lose you
