Heart beats fast / Colors and promises
How to be brave? / How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away some [Am] how

    | G - - D/F# | Em - - Gs2/D | C - - C/G | G - - Ds4/A
    I have died every day waiting for you
    Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you
    For a thousand years / I'll love you for a thousand more   [C, CM7] (fade)

| Cadd9 - - - | G/B - - - | Em(7) -  D  G |
Time stands still / Beauty in all she is
I will be brave / I will not let a-ny-thing take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath, every hour has come to [Am] this
| Am7      Em/B    D
One  step  clo  -  ser

    | G - - D/F# | Em - - Gs2/D | C - - C/G | G - - Ds4/A
    I have died every day waiting for you
    Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you
    For a thousand years / I'll love you for a thousand more
    And all along I believed I would find you
    Time has brought your heart to me
    I have loved you for a thousand years
    I'll love you for a thousand more ... (instrumental)

[quietly]
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years / I'll love you for a thousand more [crescendo]
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
