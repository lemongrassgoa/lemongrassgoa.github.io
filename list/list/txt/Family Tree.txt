Family Tree (orig. Em)

    Bop bop

Care about the moonlight / And holding you tight
And asking my questions / Ev-ery-one loves a situation

Long walks on the beach / The press will impeach
Lately I'm finding I / am the book and you are the binding

    I guess they'll read / everything about you
    Though the press might shoot me down / I'm still true
    I sell my book for free / That's what you do to me
    
    Oh, you are ... my family tree / Be good to me
    Take care of me

    Bop bop

There's hotels in the sea / Trash in the sky
The net-dustry's growing / Stick to love songs kid
That's all you're knowing

They push you away / Or tie you up
It don't really matter / But if your head is up
You won't get much sadder

    But who am I / to preach a word or two
    When I can't lift my own head / without you?
    If my mental state kept you from coming around
    I hope the world would shoot me down for losing you
    A broken branch I'd be / if you weren't grown to me
    
    Oh, you are ... my family tree / Be good to me
    Be good to me
    Be good to me
    Take care of me
    Bop bop
