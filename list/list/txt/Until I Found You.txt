INTRO: | A      C#m        D       Dm ...

| A             C#m      D - Dm
Georgia, wrap me up in all your-
I want you / in my arms
Oh, let me / hold you
I'll never let you go again / like I did
Oh, I [E7] used to say ...

    |        D             E                A       C#m
    "I would never fall in love again until I found her"
    |        D             E                A          A7
    I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
    |      D               E                 A       C#m
    I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
    |       D          Dm
    I found you ...

| A             C#m      D - Dm
Georgia, pulled me in
I asked to love her once again
You fell, I caught you
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, I [E7] used to say

    |        D             E                A       C#m
    "I would never fall in love again until I found her"
    |        D             E                A          A7
    I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
    |      D               E                 A       C#m
    I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her

    I found you ...
