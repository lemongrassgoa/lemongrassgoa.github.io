The Boxer
Simon and Garfunkel (capo 1) [rhythm: Pop 1, bpm: 185]

C                                      Em     Am
I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told
       G                                G7                               C
I have squandered my resistance / For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
    Em       Am             G                 F
All lies and jests, still a man hears what he wants to hear
                   C         G       C
And disregards the rest, hmm-mmm
       C                                         Em     Am
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
       G                             G7                          C
In the company of strangers / In the quiet of a railway station, running scared
       Am           G              F                                C
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
        G              F               C
Looking for the places only they would know

       Am          Em7              Am         G7      C
Lie la lie, lie la la la la la lie, lie la lie

       C                                         Am
Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job
             G               G7                                 C
But I get no offers / Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
        Am               G                F
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
                    C             G7          C
I took some comfort there / La la la la la

(INTERLUDE)

Now the years are rolling by me
They are rocking evenly
I am older than I once was
And younger than I'll be, that's not unusual
No it isn't strange after changes upon changes
We are more or less the same
After changes we are more or less the same

       Am          Em7              Am         G7      C
Lie la lie, lie la la la la la lie, lie la lie

         C                                              Am
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
      G                G7                           C
Going home / where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Em        Am      G      C
Leading me, going home ...

       C                                              Am
In the clearing stands the boxer and a fighter by his trade
      G                      G7
And he carries a reminder of ev'ry glove that laid him down
   C                                              Am
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
     G             F                                 C        G     F     C
I am leaving, I am leaving / But the fighter still remains

       Am          Em7              Am         G7      C
Lie la lie, lie la la la la la lie, lie la lie
