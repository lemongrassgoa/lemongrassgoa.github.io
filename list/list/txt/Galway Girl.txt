Ed Sheeran
Galway Girl (orig F#m) [rhythm: Groove 1, bpm: 100]

    She [Em] played the fiddle in an [G] Irish band 
    But she [D] fell in love with an [C] English man
    [Cadd9] Kissed her on the neck and then I [G] took her by the hand
    Said [D] baby I just want to dance

I met her on [Em] Grafton street right [G] outside of the bar
She shared a [D] cigarette with me while her [C] brother played guitar
She asked me [Em] what does it mean the Gaelic [G] ink on your arm?
Said it was [D] one of my friend's songs do you [N.C.] want to drink on?

She took [Em] Jamie as a chaser, [G] Jack for the fun
She got [D] Arthur on the table, with [C] Johnny riding as shot gun
[Am] Chatted some more, one more [G] drink at the bar
Then put [D] Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know

    She [Em] played the fiddle in an [G] Irish band 
    But she [D] fell in love with an [C] English man
    [Cadd9] Kissed her on the neck and then I [G] took her by the hand
    Said [D] baby I just want to dance
    With  my  pretty little [C] Galway [G] Girl   [D]     [Em]
    You're my pretty little [C] Galway [G] Girl   [D]     [Em]

You know she [Em] beat me at darts and then she [G] beat me at pool
And then she [D] kissed me like there was nobody [C] else in the room
As last [Em] orders were called, was when she [G] stood on the stool
After [D] dancing the ceilidh, [N.C.] singing to trad tunes

I never [Em] heard Carrickfergus ever [G] sung so sweet
Aca[D]-pella in the bar using her [C] feet for a beat
Oh I could [Am] have that voice playing on re[G]-peat for a week
And in this [D] packed out room, swear she was singing to me, you know

    She [Em] played the fiddle in an [G] Irish band 
    But she [D] fell in love with an [C] English man
    [Cadd9] Kissed her on the neck and then I [G] took her by the hand
    Said [D] baby I just want to dance

    My pretty little [C] Galway [G] Girl   [D]     [Em]
    My my my my my my my Galway girl
    My my my my my my my Galway girl
    My my my my my my my Galway girl

(quietly)
Now we've [Em] outstayed our welcome and it's [G] closing time
I was [D] holding her hand, her [C] hand was holding mine
Our [Em] coats both smell of smoke, [G] whisky and wine
As we [D] fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
(louder)
I [Em] walked her home then she [G] took me inside
[D] Finish some Doritos and another [C] bottle of wine
I [Em] swear I'm going to put you in a [G] song that I write
About a [D] Galway girl and a perfect night

    (quietly)
    She [Em] played the fiddle in an [G] Irish band 
    But she [D] fell in love with an [C] English man
    [Cadd9] Kissed her on the neck and then I [G] took her by the hand
    Said [D] baby I just want to dance [crescendo]

    My pretty little [C] Galway [G] Girl   [D]     [Em]
    My my my my my my my Galway girl
    My my my my my my my Galway girl
    My my my my my my my Galway girl
