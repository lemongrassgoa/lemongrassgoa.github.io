Frank Sinatra
I've Got You Under My Skin  (Capo 2) (transpose to Am)

|    Em7/D            DM7    Em7/D                    DM7
I've got you under my skin / I've got you deep in the heart of me
|  Em7/D            A7s4 - A+ - DM7 - D6 - D7 - Ebo7
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of  me
|    Em7     A7s4 - A7  DM7     B7
I've got you under my   skin


|   Em7/D   /B  A7s4     DM7
I'd tried so not to give in
|  Em7b5                      A7s4       DM7
I said to myself: this affair never will go so well
|   C#m7                F#7                 B- - BM7 - Ebm7 - B7
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
|    Em7     A7s4 - A7 - DM7
I've got you under  my  skin


|   Em/D - Em7/B - A7s4 - A+
I'd sacrifice anything come what might
|       DM7 - D6 - D7 - B7
For the sake of havin' you near
|             Em/D               Em7b5
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
|     F#m7 - B7 - Em7 - A7 (A+)
And repeats, repeats in my ear:
             how it yells in my ears
|         Bm7             GmM7 - A7 - DM7 - D6 - D7 - Ebo7
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
|        Em7        A7s - A+        DM7       Am7 - D7
Use your mentality,  wake up to reality
                     step up to reality
|        GM7                     Gm6
But each time that I do just the thought of you
|        D/F#          Bm/D    (E7/G#)
Makes me stop before I begin
|           Em7   A7s     DM7      (B7, Ebo7)
'Cause I've got you under my skin.
(Yes, I've got you under my skin.)
