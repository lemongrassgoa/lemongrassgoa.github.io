Nickel Creek (Sinead Lohan)
Out of the Woods (guitar tuning D-A-D-G-A-D)

(VERSE 1)
           D
I wish you out of the woods
                        G(sus2)
And into a picture with me
           D
I wish you over the moon
                             G(sus2)
Come out of the question and be

(REFRAIN)
                 D   A           G
If this is gonna run round in my head

I might as well be dreaming
D   A           G
Run round in my head

(VERSE 2)
        D
I rollercoaster for you
                         G
Time out of mind must be heavenly
           D
It's all enchanted and wild
                                    G
It's just like my heart said it was gonna be
