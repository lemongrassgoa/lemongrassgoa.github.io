INTRO:  Am   C/G   D/F#        C/E      G

            G                D              Bm             Em
VERSE 1: An empty street, an empty house, a hole inside my heart
             C                                D
         I'm all alone, the rooms are getting smaller.

           G             D             Bm                Em
LINK:    I wonder how, I wonder why, I wonder where they are
             C                C        A7/C#    Ds4         D
         The days we had, the songs we sang  to-gether, oh, yeah.
             Am   C/G   D/F#       G         C
         And all  my    love, I'm holding on forever
         Am               C                  Ds4   D
         Reaching for the love that seems so far
         
              C            G
REFRAIN: So I say a little prayer
         And hope my dreams will take me there
                   C                 G       Em     A        D
         Where the skies are blue to see you once a-gain, my love.
              C                  G
         Over seas from coast to coast
         To find the place I love the most
                   C                   G       Em     A    D      G
         Where the fields are green to see you once a-gain ... my love.
         
           G              D               Bm               Em
VERSE 2: I try to read, I go to work, I'm laughing with my friends
             C                                D
         But I can't stop to keep myself from thinking, oh, no.

                   C                   G       Em     A      B7
         Where the fields are green to see you once a-gain ...

            B7             Em       A7             D
BRIDGE:  To hold you in my arms, to promise you my love,
            B7                Em            A7             Ds4   D
         To tell you from the heart, you're all I'm thinking of.
