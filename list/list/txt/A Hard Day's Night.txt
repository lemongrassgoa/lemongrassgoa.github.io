A Hard Day's Night

G7sus4/D
 
            G    C     G
It's been a hard day's night
              F              G
and I've been working like a dog
            G    C     G
It's been a hard day's night
            F               G
I should be sleeping like a log
           C
But when I get home to you
           D
I find the things that you do
             G    C   G
will make me feel all right
 
           G    C   G
You know I work all day
           F                G
to get you money, to buy you things 
         G                C        G
and it's worth it just to hear you say
             F            G    
you're gonna give me everything
          C
So why on earth should I moan
             D
cause when I get you alone
              G    C   G
you know I'll feel o - kay
 
 
             Bm   Em                     Bm
    When I'm home everything seems to be right
             G    Em                     C6     D
    When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah!
 
            G    C     G
It's been a hard day's night
              F              G
and I've been working like a dog
            G    C     G
It's been a hard day's night
            F               G
I should be sleeping like a log
           C
But when I get home to you
           D
I find the things that you do
             G    C   G
will make me feel all right
