Intro: |  Gm           Cm      Gm       Eb  Dm  Gm 


| Gm    %    Cm    Gm    /    Eb - Dm - Gm    Cm    Gm
Shut the gates at sunset / After that you can't get out
You can see the bigger picture / Find out what it's all about
You're open to the skyline / You won't want to go back home
In a garden full of angels / You will never be alone

    | Eb     Dm      Gm
    But oh the road is long
    The stones that you are walking on Have gone

    | Gm   %   F   %   /   Bb   C   Gm   %
    With the moonlight to guide you / Feel the joy of being alive
    The day that you stop running / Is the day that you arrive
    And the night that you got locked in / Was the time to decide
    Stop chasing shadows / Just enjoy the ride

| Gm    %    Cm    Gm    /    Eb - Dm - Gm    Cm    Gm
If you close the door to your house / Don't let anybody in
It's a room that's full of nothing / All that underneath your skin
Face against the window / You can't watch it fade to grey
And you'll never catch the fickle wind / If you choose to stay

    | Eb     Dm      Gm
    But oh the road is long
    The stones that you are walking on Have gone

    | Gm   %   F   %   /   Bb   C   Gm   %
    With the moonlight to guide you / Feel the joy of being alive
    The day that you stop running / Is the day that you arrive
    And the night that you got locked in / Was the time to decide
    Stop chasing shadows / Just enjoy the ride
    Stop chasing shadows / Just enjoy the ride

(interlude) | Gm   %   F   %   /   Bb   C   Gm   %

| Eb     Dm      Gm
But oh the road is long
The stones that you are walking on Have gone

    | Gm   %   F   %   /   Bb   C   Gm   %
    With the moonlight to guide you / Feel the joy of being alive   \
    The day that you stop running / Is the day that you arrive      |
    And the night that you got locked in / Was the time to decide   |   x2
    Stop chasing shadows / Just enjoy the ride                      /
