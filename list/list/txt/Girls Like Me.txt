Miranda Lambert
Girls Like Me

F   C   G
You don't need a girl like me 
I've got bruises you can't see 
F   C   G   Am      F   G   C
And when the lights go out 
I won't be around 
You don't need a girl like me 

You can't have a heart like mine 
But you can hold it for a while 
and when the lights go out 
I won't be around 
You can't have a heart like mine 

There's a rule that goes unwritten 
And I break it from time to time 
If you're fool enough to listen 
Then I'm fool enough to lie 

That's the kind of girl I am 
I take off before I land 
And even though you think you can 
You can't change the way I am 

Cause the rule remains unwritten 
I still break it from time to time 
If you're fool enough to listen 
Then I'm fool enough to lie 

You can't change the way I am 
You don't need a girl like me
