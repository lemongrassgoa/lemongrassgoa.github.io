INTRO: Em7
 
|            Dm7    /G         CM7     Am7
Her name was Lola /  She was a showgirl
|           F#m7b5          B7           Em7add9
With yellow feathers in her hair / And a dress cut down to there
|           Dm7     /G          CM7     C6
She would merengue / And do the cha-cha
|             F#m7b5        B7          Em7add9
And while she tried to be a star / Tony always tended bar
 
|              B7(b9)  Em
    Across the crowded floor
|                    B7(b9)    Em
    They worked from eight til four
|             Am                      B7
    They were young and they had each other
|             Em7   Eb+   Dm6   (A9)
    Who could ask   for   more
 
|          Dm7    /G      CM7    A+
    At the Copa,   Copa-cabana
|       Dm7           /G        CM7
    The hottest spot north of Havana
|   A+     Dm7    /G      Em7/B   A7
    At the Copa,     Copacaba  -  na
|   Dm7       G7           Em7        A7             Dm7 (ascend bass) > B7
    Music and passion were always the fashion at the Copa  ....
 
|            Em7
They fell in love ...   
 
|            Dm7    /G          CM7
His name was Rico  /  He wore a diamond
|           F#m7b5        B7             Em7
As he was escorted to his chair / He saw Lola dancing there
|            Dm7       /G             CM7
And when she finished / He called her over
|        F#m7b5         B7          Em7
But Rico went a bit too far  / Tony sailed across the bar
 
|                B7          Em
    And then the pun - ches  flew
|                   B7         Em
    And chairs were smashed in two
|             Am                 B7
    There was blood and a single gunshot
|            Em7   Eb+   Dm6   (A9)
    But just who   shot  who?
 
|          Dm7    /G      CM7    A+ 
    At the Copa,   Copa-cabana
|       Dm7           /G        CM7
    The hottest spot north of Havana

    Music and passion were always the fashion at the Copa  ....
 
|            Em7
She lost her love...   
 
(interlude) | [ Em7     ]  ... B7

| Em
  
|            Dm7    /G          CM7
Her name was Lola  /  She was a showgirl
|            F#m7b5      B7               Em7
But that was many years ago  /  When they used to have a show
|          Dm7    /G             CM7
Now it's a disco  /  But not for Lola
|            F#m7b5            B7           Em7
Still in the dress she used to wear / Faded feathers in her hair

|                  B7        Em
    She sits there so   re - fined
|                 B7          Em
    And drinks herself half - blind
|                Am                     B7
    She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
|             Em7   Eb+  Dm6   (A9)
    Now she's lost  her  mind
 
|          Dm7    /G      CM7    A+ 
    At the Copa,   Copa-cabana
