Ring Of Fire
Johnny Cash (orig G#)

| B       E       B               B       F#    B
Love is a burning thing  / And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by  wild  desire  / I fell into a ring of fire

    | F#          E               B                     \
    I fell into a burning ring of fire,                 |
    |      F#                       E           B       |
    I went down, down, down and the flames went higher  |   x2
    |      B                                            |
    And it burns, burns, burns                          |
    |   E       B         F#      B                     /
    The ring of fire, the ring of fire.

| B          E       B            B           F#   B
The taste of love is sweet / When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child / Oh, but the fire went wild

    | F#          E               B                      \
    I fell into a burning ring of fire,                  |
    |      F#                       E           B        |
    I went down, down, down and the flames went higher   |   x2
    |      B                                             |
    And it burns, burns, burns                           |
    |   E       B         F#      B                      /
    The ring of fire, the ring of fire.                  

    |      B
    And it burns, burns, burns
    |   E       B         F#      B
    The ring of fire, the ring of fire.
    |   E       B         F#      B
    The ring of fire, the ring of fire.
