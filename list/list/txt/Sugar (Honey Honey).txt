Sugar / Ah, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you

Honey / Ah, sugar, sugar
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you

I just can't believe The loveliness of loving you
(I just can't believe it's true)
I just can't believe The wonder of this feeling, too

When I kissed you, girl I knew how sweet a kiss could be

Like the summer sunshine Pour your sweetness over me
(Pour your sweetness over me)

Ohh, sugar                              \
Pour your sugar on me, honey            |

Yeah, yeah, yeah                        |
Pour your sugar on me, oh yeah          /

Ah, sugar
Ah-ah-ah, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you
