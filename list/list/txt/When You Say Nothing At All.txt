When You Say Nothing At All
Ronan Keating (orig. G)

It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may, I can never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

    The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
    There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
    The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
    You say it best, when you say nothing at all

All day long, I can hear people talking out loud (ooh)
But when you hold me near (you hold me near) you drown out the crowd (out the crowd)
Try as they may, they can never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

    The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
    There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
    The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
    You say it best (you say it best) when you say nothing at all
    
(interlude)

Oh, the smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me ...

The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (you say it best) when you say nothing at all

That smile on your face (you say it best)
(When you say nothing at all) the truth in your eyes
The touch of your hand lets me know that you need me 
(you say it best, when you say nothing at all)
(You say it best, when you say nothing at all) nothing at all
(You say it best, when you say nothing at all) nothing at all
(You say it best, when you say nothing at all) nothing at all
nothing at all
