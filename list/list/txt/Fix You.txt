Fix You
Coldplay [rhythm: Groove 1, bpm: 75]

[D   D/C#   D/B   D/C#]
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

[D   D/C#   D/B   D/C#]
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse? [A]

    Lights will guide you home / And ignite your bones
    And I will try to fix you

[D   D/C#   D/B   D/C#]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth [A]

Lights will guide you home / And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
