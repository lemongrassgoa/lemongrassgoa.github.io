Lemon Tree
Fool's Garden

Em   Bm   ...  Am7   Bm7   Em
I'm sitting here in a boring room
it's just another rainy Sunday afternoon.
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do.
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you,
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

Em   Bm   ...  Am7   Bm7   Em
I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast, I'm-a driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view.
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you,
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

    G    D    Em   Bm   /   C    D    G   D
    I wonder how, I wonder why
    yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    and all that I can see / is just a yellow lemon tree
    G    D    Em   Bm   /   C    A    D   %
    I'm turning my head up and down
    I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around.
    And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.

Em   Bm   ...  Am7   Bm7   Em
Sing: dah...

Em   Bm   ...  Am7   Bm7   Em
I'm sitting here, I miss the power
I'd like to go out, taking a shower
but there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
I feel so tired, put myself into bed
where nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

[B7] Isolation - [Em] is not good for me.
[D]  Isolation - [G] I don't want to [B7] sit on a lemon tree.
I'm steppin' around in a desert of joy
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
and everything will happen - and you'll wonder.

    G    D    Em   Bm   /   C    D    G   D
    I wonder how, I wonder why
    yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    and all that I can see / is just a yellow lemon tree
    G    D    Em   Bm   /   C    A    D   %
    I'm turning my head up and down
    I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around.
    And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.
    And I wonder, wonder

    G    D    Em   Bm   /   C    D  ...  G
    I wonder how, I wonder why
    yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    and all that I can see
    and all that I can see
    and all that I can see
    is just a yellow lemon tree
