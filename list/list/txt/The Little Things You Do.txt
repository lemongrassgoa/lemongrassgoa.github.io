The Little Things You Do
Mikey McCleary ft Anushka Manchanda

The litte things you do / For me, and nobody else
Make me feel good
The little things you do / For me, making me smile
When no one else could

    That's why / I like to sit, next to you
    And hear your mad stories / I know they're not true
    And I like that we share a secret or two / Together

The little things you say / To me, and nobody else
Make me feel good
The little things you say / To me, make me laugh out loud
And not when I should

    Thats why / I like to hang out with you
    I never can guess / The next mad thing you'll do
    And I like that we've made, a mistake or two / Together

    And you send me / Handwritten letters
    And postcards, wherever you go
    And you lend me, books that you've read
    And God knows, how much that shows

The little things you do / For me, and nobody else
Make me feel good
The little things you do / For me, making me smile
When no one else could

    That's why / I like to sit, next to you
    And hear your mad stories / I know they're not true
    And I like that we share a secret or two / Together

The little things you do
For me, and nobody else
Make me feel good
