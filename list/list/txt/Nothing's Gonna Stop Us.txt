Nothing's Gonna Stop Us

Looking in your eyes I see a paradise
This world that I've found is too good to be true
Standing here beside you, want so much to give you
This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you
Let 'em say we're crazy, I don't care about that
Put your hand in my hand, baby, don't ever look back

Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart
And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now, no

I'm so glad I found you, I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes, I will stay here with you
Take it to the good times, see it through the bad times
Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do
Let 'em say we're crazy, what do they know?
Put your arms around me, baby, don't ever let go

Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart
And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us

Oh, all that I need is you, baby
You're all that I ever need
And all that I want to do
Is hold you forever, forever and ever
Hey

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
(Build this dream together)
