I knew a man Bojangles and he'd dance for you,      in worn-out shoes.
C               C/B              Am7         C/G   F                 G
With silver hair a ragged shirt and baggy pants,    he did the old soft shoe.

He jumped so high, jumped so high,     then he'd lightly touch down.

I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was        down and out.
C               C/B    Am7         C/G  F                    G
He looked to me to be the eyes of age        as he spoke right out.
F               C    E7         Am   C/G   D7/F#                           G     G7
He talked of life, talked of life,        he laughed, slapped his leg a step.


C               C/B               Am7          C/G  F            G
He said his name, Bojangles, then he danced a lick,      across the cell.
C                     C/B                  Am7           C/G F                 G
He grabbed his pants for better stance, oh he jumped up high.     He clicked his heels,
F       C      E7         Am   C/G D7/F#                      G  G7
he let go a laugh, let go a laugh,    shook back his clothes all around.

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs    throughout the south.
C                  C/B                   Am7       C/G F           G
He spoke with tears of fifteen years how his dog and he      traveled about.
F                C    E7      Am   C/G     D7/F#                            G  G7
His dog up and died, up and died,         After twenty years he still grieved.


C                        C/B              Am7        C/G  F               G
He said, "I dance now at every chance in honky tonks       for drinks and tips.
C                      C/B                Am7            C/G    F            G
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars". He said, "I drinks a bit."
F                 C    E7               Am    C/G  D7/F#                      G  G7
He shook his head and he shook his head,       I heard someone ask him please,
